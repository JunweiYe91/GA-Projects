### Introduction:

Welcome to Junwei's Github. This Github consists of the projects I have done through out my time in General Assembly. I have included a summary of the projects down below. Feel free to look through the files!

### Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis

#### Project Objectives:
Identify the states in the United States that has the most potential to increase the SAT participation rate and make recommendations to the College Board on where the efforts should be focused on. Give some recommendations on what could be done.

#### Skills Required:
- Basic statistics and probability
- Many Python programming concepts
- Programmatically interacting with files and directories
- Visualizations
- EDA
- Working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting

### Project 2: Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

#### Project Objectives:
You have been tasked by your direct supervisor to create a regression model to predict the price of houses in Ames, so that these prices can be included in the platform. You will also need to identify factors affecting sales price and make recommendations on what could be done to improve sales income.

#### Skills Required:
- Refining models over time
- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process
- Building models for regression focused problems
- The use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science

### Project 3: Web APIs & NLP

#### Project Objectives:
You have been tasked by your direct supervisor to create a classification model to identify whether posts should be classified in the Makeup or Perfumes column. At the same time, use the analysis to identify useful insights that could be used by the marketing department for their marketing efforts.

#### Skills Required:
- Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition
- Natural Language Processing and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.
- Building models for classification focused problems

### Capstone Project: Credit Card Recommender

#### Project Objectives:
You've want to sign up for a credit card that best fits you, but you've realised that you will need to comb through all card descriptions, conditions and reviews in order to decide which card is the best. You find that it is very inconvenient and as a data scientist, you decide to take it upon yourself to build a credit card recommender.

Use different techniques to analyse the reviews, credit card conditions to derive a credit card recommender that could help to save a lot of time when choosing a credit card.

#### Skills Required:
- Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition via Beautiful Soup and Selenium
- Natural Language Processing and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.
- Understanding of BERT to perform sentiment analysis
- Building models for multi target classification focused problems
- Deployment of models using Streamlit
