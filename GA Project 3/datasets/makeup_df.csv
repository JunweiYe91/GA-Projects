3,Makeup,Eyeshadow Fallout Question,"My apologies - my last post wasn't very clear so I'm going to rephrase this...

If there was a non make up product that prevents eyeshadow fallout, would you purchase it? This means you won't need to apply your eyeshadow on before your face make up e.g. Foundation, powder, concealer, etc. 

Thank you in advance for your replies!"
4,Makeup,Make up to cover a tattoo in an extreme climate,"Hi, I‚Äôm a guy that‚Äôs never wore make up before so I‚Äôm pretty clueless. 

I need something to cover up a tattoo which is going to affect a job otherwise. I will be working in a climate where it‚Äôs going to be around 35 degrees and very humid so it‚Äôs going to have to be sweat, heat and water proof. 

I would also prefer if it was an easy application rather than having to put many layers on but I do understand multiple layers may be required. 

I have done some research into this but all the brands I‚Äôve looked up all have fantastic and terrible reviews at the same time so thought it would be best to ask here. 

By the way the tattoo is green and around 3 by 1 inch in size. It is also currently under laser removal which it hasn‚Äôt seemed to of budged much in 4 sessions. 

Any help is appreciated!"

19,Makeup,Why do so many people not put mascara on their bottom lashes?,"It seems like so many videos I see or makeup look tutorials or trying new mascaras seem to completely neglect the lower lashes. I know the top lashes are obviously longer and more dramatic and where the effects are most noticeable but it doesn‚Äôt mean neglecting the lower lashes. Even when I was 14 and trying on my first ¬£2.50 mascara from Primark, applying it to the lower lashes always seemed like a no-brainer.

I can‚Äôt overstate how much a good mascara on my lower lashes transforms my look and eyes, making them look so much bigger and wider and more awake. I could maybe understand going light on the lower lashes for more natural/clean makeup looks, but it seems like even the tutorials for bold, dramatic looks lack mascara on the lower lashes.

IMO it should be a universal eye makeup rule, up there with highlighting the inner corner and brow bone."

35,Makeup,Tinted Moisturizer Recommendations!,"Hello!

I‚Äôm running low on my Clinique Moisture Surge tinted moisturizer and went to rebuy‚Ä¶ and the price increased to $40. It‚Äôs the only tinted moisturizer I‚Äôve really liked and that matches my skin tone. 

I‚Äôm very fair and cool/neutral toned (I wear the lightest shade in the Clinique, shade 2 in Nars creamy concealer, etc.) so I‚Äôve struggled to find a lot of options that suit both my skin tone and type. My skin is very dry so I prefer to over compensate by using dewy and moisturizing products and I‚Äôve been very happy with how my skin looks and feels. 

The Clinique has been wonderful for me but I previously purchased it on a crazy sale (I think something like $15 each, I got very lucky!). I don‚Äôt mind splurging (my go-to brands are Nars for complexion, Natasha Denona and Huda for shadows, Peter Thomas Roth and Glow Recipe for skincare so I will shell out when it‚Äôs worth it) but I can‚Äôt decide if a tinted moisturizer is worth $40.

I have experience working in a retail makeup store (the black and white one) so I am familiar with a lot of brands and have swatched and tried a lot but would love to hear some other opinions!

I would love something cool/neutral toned, at least SPF 25, moisturizing and cruelty free would be a great bonus but not necessary. 

What I‚Äôve tried (actually worn, not just swatched):
-Clinique Moisture Surge (love but pricy)
-Ilia skin tint (loved everything about this but I had a severe allergic reaction)
-Nars tinted moisturizer (no shade light enough)
-Huda Glow Wish (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called? No SPF and felt too oily)
-MyChelle (pilled like no other)
-BareMinerals (just eh)
-Covergirl (the milk line, I liked it but it would go bad so fast)
-ELF (not moisturizing enough)
-and more but these are the ones that had the biggest impression on me

Ones I‚Äôm curious about:
-Rare beauty tinted moisturizer (I‚Äôve liked everything else I‚Äôve tried by this brand)
-Winkylux (heard good things)

Thanks in advance!"

37,Makeup,Any waterline pencil recommendations?,"I love wearing black in my waterline, especially when I have eyeliner and/or eyeshadow on but they all bleed or just disappear after a while.

38,Makeup,Fenty Beauty Pro Filt‚Äôr Longwear Hydrating Foundation Issues,"I was super excited to try this foundation because my skin is more of the dry type and can get flakey.  Unfortunately I‚Äôm really disheartened by the way it wears on my skin.  It looks very cakey and it settles into my fine lines like a mfer, like it‚Äôs sitting on top of my skin rather than blending into it.  I find I have to use a lot of powder to keep it from sliding around and it definitely doesn‚Äôt help the texture that develops.

I‚Äôve tried different primers, powders, moisturizers, concealers, etc and pretty much nothing makes it look better.  So far the best luck I‚Äôve had with it has been the moisturizer then powder then primer routine but as my skin is already more dry the extra powder before ages me.

Does anyone have any tips on how to make it settle better?  I took a few quick (probably awkward lol) photos as examples that I can add or DM if anyone wants to see."

42,Makeup,My bottom lashes are too bold. Should I trim them?,"I have round eyes and a pretty good upper lash line but my lower lashes are longer and more noticeable. I don‚Äôt wear false lashes, usually just some mascara on my upper lashes, and as a result I think my eyes look much smaller than they are and less round because of the harshness of just the bottom lash line (my eyes crinkle up a lot when I smile too). If I use eyeliner it gets super dramatic really fast haha. I think if I trim the bottom lashes just a little it may complement the roundness of my eyes more, with my natural top lashes. Would this be a bad idea?"

I got my gf some kokie eyeliner since that‚Äôs her favorite and I‚Äôm hoping to get a hipdot eyeliner in time since they‚Äôre both her favorite.

I've also tried the KOSE SOFTYMO Speedy Cleansing Oil a few times, does a good job but would like to reserve it as a makeup remover since it's the only thing that doesn't sting my eyes to remove waterproof mascara."
51,Makeup,Kohl/Kajal without lead?,"I‚Äôve wanted to try it for a while because I like to look, but found out a lot of it contains lead. What are your favorite brands that don‚Äôt have lead?

Also, if anyone knows, are there actually any benefits other than sun protection? I hear it can improve vision and is anti bacterial/prevents eye disease."
52,Makeup,Lipstick advice,"Hi all! Hoping someone can help me.
Lipstick never stays on my lips all day- I've tried everything from exfoliating to using lipbalm, using lipsticks known for their staying power and using lipcote too.

It lifted up my make horribly and I am not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong with this primer. No other primer has done that to my make up. I always prep my skin with moisturizer, serum and sunscreen and for my base I use very light foundations like the cover girl clean fresh skin milk. Over all I always make sure to wear light layers to not look cakey but this primer does the quit opposite.

I smashed our feeling sad and depressed because I thought I just wasted money on sheer shadows. I got home, slapped on some primer, and sun beige superstay 24 hour. I took out the felt tip applicator and loaded up the applicator chock full of shadow and pressed it firmly and then slowly swiped, When I tell you my jaw hit the floor with how pigmented, how full coverage it was, I audibly gasped, I was in shock.

111,Makeup,Should tinted moisturiser be set with powder?,"I got the Laura Mercier oil free tinted moisturiser recently which has great reviews. It‚Äôs my first tinted moisturiser so I don‚Äôt have any other experience with them &amp; I guess I saw it differently to foundation &amp; thought the point was it was meant to be low maintenance &amp; you just put it on &amp; go, treating it like I would wearing moisturiser. But I was a total oil slick in an hour or two &amp; it looked terrible.

Should I be wearing it the same way I wear foundation, setting it with powder &amp; also using primer/fixing spray if needed? And whilst I‚Äôm on the subject should I also be putting my normal moisturiser on first, or is this meant to moisturise adequately alone?

I guess I‚Äôm disappointed as that doesn‚Äôt seem any less effort than wearing foundation is, but maybe that‚Äôs my own mistake for expecting that from it &amp; the only difference is meant to be that it‚Äôs more lighter &amp; natural looking? Though that just makes me think I can get the same effect by using less of my normal foundation &amp; more sheered out or even mixed in with my moisturiser."

135,Makeup,Boyfriend looking for Purchase Recommendations?,"Hi everybody, hopefully I'm in the right subreddit or can get sent there by one of you!

So my partner is pretty hard to shop for and experiences an amount of ""gift anxiety"" (feelings of ""I don't deserve this/it's too nice for me/buying me stuff is a waste"") that makes gift giving even trickier, but recently we were at a Winners and came across some of what I think are called palettes? They're little packs with 12 to 16 different coloured squares of makeup that seem to be used for eyeshadow. And apparently they were exciting enough that I was allowed to buy one as a gift! Which was something I haven't experienced before with this partner because again, there's a lot of negative/guilty emotions around gift giving that I'm always kind of running up against. 

The three total we wound up with were called **Rude x Koi Footwear Boots Collection - Helios Hologram Flame Boots, Rude x Koi Footwear Boots Collection - Lozo Green Rain Boots** and **BH Cosmetics Avocado Toast Shadow Palette** and all three have been super popular already.

Anyway, now that I seem to have an outlet to express my gift giving affection I'd like to learn more about what would be worth buying in the future. I have very little understanding of makeup but I can give some rough notes about my partner;

Winged eyeliner, mascara and eyeshadow is pretty common but lipstick apparently comes across ""trashy"" a lot of the time (I guess because it's a bit dolled up or showy or something?) and the general vibe is pretty alternative, punk, probably goth but I have to be a bit careful with that because I have kind of a known goth girl dating history and it would maybe land wrong as a gift if it seemed like I was pressuring my current partner to dress up as previous partners/flings/etc. Aside from that, not much for coverup/foundation/etc., it's mostly all just... eyework? Is that what you call it?

The palettes are getting a ton of use but from reading online it seems like these are maybe like, ""cheap"" ones or entry level or sort of frugal? I try to equate it with stuff I know like coffee or car parts where you can buy higher grade stuff for a better experience, I assume it's similar here? Are there higher quality palettes that still have the fun alt kind of vibes? 

Aside from that for mascara or eyeliner we seem to usually just wind up with whatever is at Walmart or the pharmacy - usually that Elf brand stuff. I don't know if Elf is fine, I think every girl I've ever dated had some of that in their bathroom, but again connecting to what I am familiar with, Wal-Mart coffee or engine oil isn't really something I'd go in for.

Budget is basically whatever, I'm sure there are like ten thousand dollar kits or whatever that would make me feel silly for saying that but these were super cheap and I'd be happy spending more to get better stuff to use. I'm also down for any kind of links for reading or whatever so I can understand what I'm doing better and not buy pointless stuff, if anyone has any of that?

Thanks in advance, everybody!"
136,Makeup,Misprint or knock-off?,"I have been trying so hard to find a review of this one lipstick that I bought from my local beauty store because it's on sale. But I found none.

The box on it says 'Rouge volupte shine collector oil in stick 76 golden', which obviously doesn't exists. I try to look for the actual name of it and found out that it's 'Yves Saint Laurent Rouge Volupt√© Shine Lipstick Holiday Collector Lipstick, 76 Red In The Dark'.

Now I think this might have happened because the products are on sale so maybe it's a product that had misprints or has been on the shelf for too long (I have no idea how any of these works). But when I checked up with the other one there's no problem with it. What do I do should I call up the store and ask? I am so paranoid."

157,Makeup,Ilia Super Serum Skin Tint VS. Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer Natural Skin Perfector,"I‚Äôve recently purchased both of these products while looking for an alternative to foundation.  I really love both products and they seem to look the same on me, so I don‚Äôt need to keep both of them but can‚Äôt decide which to return/keep. They both have similar ratings on EWG but different flagged ingredients (see below) so I‚Äôm trying to determine if one is better/safer than the other in that regard but I don‚Äôt know much about skincare chemicals but I‚Äôm pregnant and want to keep it as clean as I can.

Ilia pros are that it has a light, smooth coverage with SPF 40. Cons are that it smells awful and has zinc oxide (12%).

Laura Mercier pros are that it also has a light smooth coverage but no detectable scent. Cons are that the SPF 30 is lower than Ilia‚Äôs and it contains oxybenzone (1%).

Can anyone weigh in on which one they think is the keeper? Or give me a really good reason to keep both?"

167,Makeup,Eyelash extensions rant,"I‚Äôm not sure if this was the right sub to post in and if this is technically makeup but I‚Äôve been getting eyelash extensions for 7 years now. Before those 7 years I wore lash strips for 3 years. I‚Äôve always hated the way I look without lashes since my real lashes are very small and don‚Äôt curl (I have Asian lashes). The thing with extensions is I can just wake up and feel pretty, go swimming and still look good and even cry and not be totally disgusted by the way I look after. My boyfriend has only ever known me with my extensions too. 

The place I‚Äôve been going for the past 7 years have raised their prices from 60$ to 90$ for a fill. And on top of that they‚Äôre shortening the time from 3 weeks to 2 weeks?? It seems so unreasonable and just greedy. I‚Äôm in college now and can‚Äôt afford that extra raise. (Plus I drive an hour to the salon since it‚Äôs located in my hometown). 

I‚Äôve tried to look at new salons near me but I‚Äôm in the city so their prices are the same if not more expensive. And I have thought about just cutting off but these extensions have really given me more confidence in myself. Also I love just waking up and being ready to go. I‚Äôm debating to have my boyfriend learn how to do them and just buying lash kits online.

Im just pissed at how expensive they are now. I would drive all the way home because how cheap they were compared to the city but now they‚Äôre just as expensive as here."
168,Makeup,Eyeliner in summer,"How do yall keep your eyeliner from running/watering when its hot as hell out?

169,Makeup,Snapchat blush hack?,Yesterday I was mindlessly watching different episodes/shows on Snapchat on the discover page and I came across a girl who used blush as a ‚Äúfoundation hack‚Äù where she drew arrows on diff parts of her face with blush and blended it. I wanted to try it for myself but I can‚Äôt find the video now. Does anyone know what I‚Äôm talking about by chance?
170,Makeup,Makeup Wipe Rec Needed,"I don't use makeup wipes regularly since I prefer the deep and gentle clean of an oil / balm remover. Most of the time my makeup is incredibly minimal - just spot concealing. So the whole process of going through the massaging, the emulsifying, and the rinsing can feel a bit overbearing. At those times I wipe off the makeup using a micellar water and a cotton pad. Which is fine when I'm at home.   


But for travel (especially on days when I spending the night at someone's house), I wouldn't mind the ease of a one step wipe to remove my minimal makeup. Of course I would cleanse afterwards. I wouldn't do this often since wipes can seem wasteful and harsh on the skin. But in a pinch it seems like a good product to have. Makeup balms / oils can kinda gunk up the sink so I feel horrible about doing that to another person's sink. What makeup wipes would you recommend?"

172,Makeup,Kylie Jenner Baddie On The Block Pressed Blush on - Review,"So, i got it as a gift for Christmas and I feel like i'm still half-hearted on using it since I've always been a lip tint type of gal and don't really prefer using a powdered blush. And I'm kind of acne-prone and so far i've had pimples but not exactly sure if it's just me or the brush or the make up itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

But upon reading the features of this make up. This kind of looks good and is very helpful. Knowing Kylie Jenner's brand of make up she's received a lot of hate for it but i think it's normal to any brand that's starting. so i guess im just gonna give it a try but what do you guys think? for those who have tried it/currently using it? Does it live up to the name?

&amp;#x200B;

173,Makeup,lipstick recommendations for an overwhelmed person,"hi! so im new to makeup but i do like a little color on my lips and im particularly interested with this popular look of korean style lips; i love how soft and kind of 'natural' the lips look

doing research ive seen they mostly use lip stains i cant find at ulta (and the ones they have are a bit expensive). it seems liquid lipstick would kind of work for the look by applying the lipstick with your fingers and blotting it, but i am scared bc liquid lipstick has always been my enemy as i have dry lips and it makes me look like a clown (not used to seeing me with obvious makeup)

so my questions is, is there a liquid lipstick that i could be able to blot on my lips without it becoming patchy and that doesnt desintegrate if i put vaseline on top to hydrate my lips?"

200,Makeup,How do y'all manage to do your makeup so quickly?,"Days ago, I got downvoted for saying that it takes me 70 minutes to do a simple makeup look. Not sure why I got downvoted, but no matter how hard I try, I can never do a full face of makeup in under an hour.

Mascara is my longest step, because my lashes won't curl unless I curl them at least 5 times each, and since my lashes as less than a centimeter long, I have to apply mascara slowly, or else I'll get it all over my eye area.

Foundation/concealer is my second longest step, because I have acne all over my face, so I use full-coverage foundation and it take forever to blend, and even after I blend it, some don't fully cover, so I have to apply some concealer over them then blend them out with my finger.

Eyeliner is my least favorite step, because it takes forever to make both sides look even.

Even blush and bronzer take me some time, because it also struggle to make both sides of my face look even.

I also wear primer, eyebrow powder, eyeshadow (usually just 2 or 3 colors), lashes, lipstick, and setting spray which adds even more time.

And if I were to do a full-glam look, that'll take me over 2 hours.

So how do you all manage to do your makeup in under an hour? By any chance, does it correspond with your general art skills? I literally can't draw or color anything, so could that be why I suck at applying makeup?"

My ‚Äúmom makeup‚Äù routine:


Toner (I don‚Äôt wash my face in the morning), moisturizer and a primer. I use a lot of different ones but current favorite is CoverGirl Outlast Stay All Day Primer. 


Next is Hollywood Flawless Filter by Charlotte Tilbury, it hides a lot of texture. I put that on my face along with ELF Hydrating Camo Concealer and blend. You can see my skin but I still have coverage. Set with Maybelline SuperStay Powder Foundation. 


Then Laura Gellar Balance ‚ÄòN Brighten Bronzer and I use either Benefit Dallas blush or Hourglass diffused heat (sometimes both.) Then blend. If I‚Äôm feeling like it I use Ciate Dewy Sticks. 


Then brows, I‚Äôm pretty blessed with nice brows but they are bleach blonde and I currently have dark hair. I fill them in with a Maybelline brow pencil and then Gimme Brow. 


If I‚Äôm really in a rush I stop there although sometimes I‚Äôll put on mascara. Otherwise I use three shadows: a matte brown for the crease, black to line the upper lash line and a highlight. I really like Milani Bold Obsessions for that but I use the Kaja stack in Chocolate Dahlia a lot too. Often use Benefit Dallas in my crease. Then Essence Doll Lash mascara and whatever setting spray I have laying around.

243,Makeup,Need Advice and Recommendations please!,"So I really am not skilled at all with my makeup. I only wear it occasionally. But I'm looking to try to improve my techniques. I know that begins with skincare, and I have type 2 rosacea. So I know my basics of 1)Cleanse 2) Moisture 3) Sunscreen. Could I please have recommendations for a decent, drugstore/inexpensive foundation? Currently, I'm using Maybelline Super Stay Full Coverage, and while it says full coverage, I still find myself having to use more than I'd like to cover up my redness. Furthermore, I find it leaves me looking over all super dry, which I do prefer a matte look, but I don't like the cakey look it gives me. Perhaps I need to look for a better primer? I know a green tinted one is good for rosacea, does anyone have a recommendation for a good green tinted one that has nice smoothing and adhering qualities, but wont necessarily break the bank? Also, when I try to blend my contour, I find doing so wipes away my foundation, and then my uneven texture and redness shows through? Please please, any tips and recommendations are very much appreciated!!!"

257,Makeup,Eyeliner wings smudging üò£,"How can I stop my eyeliner from ""bleeding""/smudging &amp; looks like I have crow's feet or just got back from a CrAzY NiGhT? ü§™

I prefer to use an eyeliner brush &amp; small, gel eyeliner pot to do my winged eyeliner. Sometimes I go over it with a liquid eyeliner because the gel fades away. If I mess up, I clean with a Q tip &amp;/or baby wipe. 

I used to do my eyeliner LAST (after concealer, foundation, powder, eyeshadow), but I thought maybe I should do my eyeliner FIRST, on a bare face? I also try to use a small brush to put foundation/powder under the wing, to clean up/prevent ""bleeding."" Do I need one of those eye primers or setting spray?

After a few minutes, I put on Est√©e Lauder Double Wear Foundation. It was going well until I wanted to apply it on my nose, upper lip area and chin. (I stipple with the Real Techniques Stippling brush which always worked well)

But something was wrong: The foundation didn't stay. It started to seperate in the middle of my nose/upper lip area/chin each time I stippled to blend it into my skin. 

I took my washcloth and gently removed the foundation in these areas and primed again there. Again, same scenario when applying the foundation there again. I also tried my MAC Pro Longwear concealer and Tarte Shape Tape. Same scenario. Even tried to prep with TO Hemi-Squalane. 

What am I doing wrong?

Info: In summer I start to sweat quickly on my nose, upper lip area and chin.

‚ñ™Ô∏èChanel - Les Beiges Water-Fresh Blush 


üí≤ Price: $50.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Luxury Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï Oh my, this year's 'Les Beiges' collection is my kryptonite - and I want EVERY single piece! I've tried a few pieces over the years, and I've always really enjoyed the thoughtful products. I MOSTLY have my eye on the 'p√™che' highlight powder, but I can't seem to find that anywhere. This blush looks super fun, and every day-appropriate. I certainly wouldn't mind testing this out and seeing what it's all about!

‚ñ™Ô∏èMelt Cosmetics - Tan Lines Liquid Highlighter Set 


üí≤ Price: $87.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: High-End Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï Okay, so I like the general IDEA of this, but the entire concept just isn't practical. For $90, you get three highlighters, but essentially only one is going to work for you - so what are you going to do with the other two? To make this more sensible, Melt should have allowed the ability for customers to be able to completely customize which three shades they want in their kit - not automatically get three stock shades. Also, I'd like to point out that the inclusion of the two buffing brushes in the kit was a nice touch!

‚ñ™Ô∏èKiko Milano - Festival Glow Eyeshadow¬† Palette 


üí≤ Price: $16.99 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Mid-End Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï I catch myself looking and looking at the Kiko website SO many times, but I hardly buy anything. I have in the past, and I LOVED the stuff I got! Their Italian-made products are super luxurious for way less of a markup, and I can certainly appreciate that. As I look at this particular quad, I think 'Charlotte Tilbury'. Granted, the formulas may be different, but the general experience could be nearly the same. I would love to pick up a few pieces from this 'festival' collection before it disappears!

‚ñ™Ô∏èSigma - 7-Shade Eyeshadow Palettes 


üí≤ Price: $27.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: High-End Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï Sigma essentially re-released their largest palettes in smaller, 7-shade forms. I definitely don't mind a smaller palette spotlighting their best shades, but here's the thing - I CANNOT stand a long, single row palette. Something about how it physically looks drives me so crazy that I would never, ever, ever use it. EVER. No matter how good the formula is, the exterior packaging alone is enough to negatively sway my interest.

‚ñ™Ô∏èGlisten Cosmetics - Chroma Flakes 


üí≤ Price: $15.50 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Indie Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï I think every time I make one of these posts, I include something from Glisten Cosmetics. It sure seems that way, anyway. I just can't help it - everything the brand creates is SO 'my style' of makeup! They produce very simple, sparkly products that leave a lot up to the imagination, and I love that. These chroma flakes have quite a nice shade selection, and no doubt would I find some way to incorporate them into an eye look. They look STUNNING!

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èJoah Beauty - Air-Light 3-pc Lipstick Trio 


üí≤ Price: $19.99 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Mid-End Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï Hmmm...since when did Joah Beauty get so dang expensive? I was looking at their website today, and the pricing for every product seems like it has SEVERELY increased. I've shopped Joah Beauty for years, and always loved their inspirational makeup at a moreso affordable price. However, the prices have crept up so much, I no longer consider this one of the 'affordable' brands anymore. Three tiny lipsticks (on sale), MARKED-DOWN to $20? No, thank you. The products look great, but their new strategy is thwarting me. 

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èI Heart Revolution - Tasty Pineapple Palette 


üí≤ Price: $15.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Affordable Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï Okay, okay - hear me out. I think the I Heart Revolution eyeshadow formula is FANTASTIC, and it's actually one of my top-most favorite eyeshadow formulas (believe-it-or-not!). I quite look forward to their palette releases, but I NEVER, EVER buy them at full price. I get them at TJ Maxx for a fraction of the cost. That's exactly what I'm going to do with this one - acknowledge it exists, and keep it on my radar until I find it for a deep discount. I love the looks and theming of this tropical pineapple one!

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èTom Ford - Soleil Eye &amp; Cheek Palette 2022 


üí≤ Price: ~$100.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Luxury Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï I'm in no way opposed to investing in solid pieces of luxury makeup, but I NEED the makeup to work for me in all aspects. Tom Ford makes some pretty pieces, but this palette only encapsulates half of what I need in a functional palette. Applied, you are going to get a very light, barely-there look - and I want more from an investment piece. As far as the component and setup - these palettes are always gorgeous, and are the pillar of which beautiful makeup should aspire. Sadly, this year - it's just not the right piece for me.

‚ñ™Ô∏èColourpop - In the Springs Palette 


üí≤ Price: $18.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Affordable Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï If you keep up with my posts, then you know I am literally WEAKSAUCE for a blue and orange color-story. Weak, I tell you. I cannot resist the callings of this palette! I want it sooo badly! I don't buy much Colourpop, but sometimes their releases captivate me in a way nothing else can - and I am powerless in my ability to refrain from it. THIS is one of those collections.

It‚Äôs super buildable so I usually only use about a pump and a half for my whole face to apply a thin layer that evens out my skin tone while still allowing freckles and beauty marks to show through. It doesn‚Äôt actually dry down matte, but it‚Äôs more matte than the original. 
What I don‚Äôt like:
Sometimes, it feels too thick- which I guess could be remedied with a face oil? But it just feels like adding in an extra step that might break down the product. 
I‚Äôve used Nars Skin Tint and Laura Mercier‚Äôs tinted moisturizer in the past, but I didn‚Äôt like how oily they made my skin feel. 

Would love any recommendations!!!"

üëâ Urban Decay - Eyeshadow Primer Potion 

// 

THOUGHTS: There are a few certain 'preferences' I MUST have in an eye primer - I prefer a 'cream-to-powder' dry-down, I need a primer that completely blanks out the entire eye area for a clean canvas, and I also want something that completely flattens-out the surface. I find that without the proper priming base,¬† eyeshadow nearly never blends properly on my eyes. This particular eyeshadow primer is iconic, but oddly enough - I've never tried it. 

I discovered that it's very easy to apply, as it comes with a handy, plush doefoot applicator that carries an adequate amount of product. I applied as much as I normally would, and blended it out with a brush. I found it a bit tough to see exactly where I had applied it due to its colorless base. After a minute or two, I felt a legitimate tightening of my eyelid as it fully dried. I suffer from pretty bad eyelid discoloration, and it didn't do very much to cover that. 

As far as performance - at NO point did this primer crease on me, which is atypical. I found that the eyeshadows I applied on top blended-out perfectly, and the primer did indeed, mend my dry patches so the shadows stick.

üëâ E.L.F. Cosmetics - Powder Foundation 

// 

THOUGHTS: As a super-hyped product, I was so excited to try this! I only 'sometimes' use a powdered-foundation, and I've always appreciated the ease-of-use. I began with a fully prepped face - including a pore-filling primer. This specific foundation product comes with an application sponge for on-the-go, but I chose to apply it with a buffing brush (Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki). 

I'll say, it didn't take me long to get completely full-coverage, and dude - do I ever LOVE it. I had to use quite a bit of the powder to get my desired look (essentially, the 'E.L.F. logo is almost dissolved in the powder) but it is so worth it. My skin looks amazing! The foundation covered up every single area-of-concern, in the most beautiful way. My face didn't look heavy, cakey, or powdery at all. Since it IS afterall, a powder, it felt curiously lightweight and comfortable upon my face. I achieved a very smooth, natural-matte finish. 

I applied both powder AND cream products over the top, and found that both types applied well, without any lifting of the foundation (and making it look patchy). Also, I want to note that I have quite a bit of peach fuzz on my face, and the powder kind of 'sticks to it', so dermaplaning would definitely be a good idea prior to using this.

üëâ Rimmel London - High'Light Buttery-Soft Highlighting Powder 

// 

THOUGHTS: I've always heard amazing things about this highlighter, and frankly - I've been intrigued. I know the 'intense highlight' trend is over, but I've never been one to 'follow the rules'. I love all sorts of makeup, not just what the trends are. Rimmel has always been one of my most-favorite drugstore brands, so I had confidence that this would be up to standard. 

It looked fairly golden in the pan, but as I¬† actually applied it, it really looked more champagne in tone. I decided to apply this in a diffused manner, with a fluffy brush. It applied so very smoothly, with a seamless application (absolutely no barrier lines). On my skin, it's my favorite type of highlight. It has a barely visible base with tiny, sparkly mica particles pieced all-around. I think it looks gorgeous, and still illuminates your skin without being extra-audacious.

üëâ Maybelline - Tattoo Studio Brow Lift Stick 

// 

THOUGHTS: I've been dying to try this product since it released, so I couldn't be more excited! This product is supposed to mindlessly give you that purposeful 'laminated brow' look. The component itself is unlike any other brow product I've ever used. The wax part is intentionally less-pigmented to only 'lightly tint' the brows. The opposite end holds a unique plastic brush and laminating tool. 

As for application - first, I brushed up my brows with a spoolie. Then I drew the wax tint over my entire brow shape. I put enough on, as to where I believed I would get a decent hold. I then used the opposite end to brush the wax evenly throughout, and then the flat-side to push them flush against my face. 

In the end, my brows maintained a nice, tinted, feathered-effect, but the wax itself wasn't strong enough to truly give them the 'professionally laminated' style. I personally like the product myself and will use it a lot, but would not recommend this to somebody looking for this as perfection (in lieu of the professional craft).

üëâ Kaleidos - Quad Palette 

// 

THOUGHTS: Kaleidos is my FAVORITE high-end makeup brand, so I feel compelled to try something from each launch. To put it plainly - I absolutely, positively, 100%, LOVED how this performed. 

This is what I look for in an every day palette. I love the ratio of mattes to shimmers. The formulations of both types of shadows are on target with other products they've previously released. This palette performs extremely high in quality, and produces a simplistic (yet dimensional) eye look. I did experience a decent amount of kick-back and fall-out as I used this. Although this is a 'neutral eye quad', you can do a lot of fun stuff with this due to its marvelous gradient-effect. 

The only thing that makes this eye quad not 'perfect', is that the shade names (nor the palette name) are not printed on the palette itself - they are located on a separate plastic insert that must be kept if you want to retain the information. As far as its peerless performance - I am most certainly impressed.

üëâ By Terry - Terrybly Velvet Rouge Liquid Velvet Lipstick 

// 

THOUGHTS: I haven't have tried much from this brand, and I figured a liquid lipstick would make for a good start. Right upon opening - this has a VERY strong rose-scent (which I do not prefer). The applicator is a circular, plush hourglass shape, which should aid in precision application without the necessity of an additional lip liner. 

I found this to be extremely easy to apply. The formula is very thin, so it needs to be built-up for its full opacity. I love how it looks overall - it's a liquid lipstick that doesn't dry my lips out and showcase every single line. When I rub my lips together, it truly has a velvet-like feeling. This is a super-comfortable formula for every day wear. However, it DOES transfer! 

Lastly, this particular liquid lipstick is NOT for those that avoid fragrance; I can heavily smell and taste this upon my lips. The scent lasts the entirety of wear-time.

335,Makeup,Help finding the right eyebrow product,"Hi everyone, I have very sparse brows (basically next to nothing), so doing my eyebrows definitely are a huge part of my makeup routine. Currently I use a brow pencil to essentially draw on my brows, but I was wondering if I should make the switch to a brow powder since I‚Äôve read that it gives a more natural brow, and I personally prefer a more natural makeup style. What‚Äôs the comparison between these products for someone with sparse brows?"
336,Makeup,How to avoid cakey melting under eye (but also full face) makeup?,"I have very oily sensitive skin and I‚Äôm also currently in California so it‚Äôs been extremely hot. When I do my makeup in the morning on my under eye area I just use concealer that I set with a finishing powder. For the rest of my face I use a light cushion foundation that I also set with the same transparent finishing powder. Within about an hour or two my entire face is a cakey creasing mess and my under eye area is completely muddy and creased, especially if I‚Äôm wearing eyeshadow of any kind, cream or powder. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do, since I have horribly oily skin I feel like I need to use finishing powder but I also feel like that contributes to the cakeyness. Setting spray also seems to have no effect. What am I doing wrong?"

As I am 18 years old and already started sunscreen on daily basis I think I have a bright future in that aspect.

However, the sunscreen i like and use leaves a good shiny finish. I don't like that and would like to counter it somehow. Got some tips about powder and my first intention was that I would never start makeup. But, in reality, it isn't that weird.

Plus, I‚Äôm looking for shadows that are solid and matte, and not so shimmery. They have the pressed powders available online but I want something I can pick up in store. 

Palettes are very fun and convenient because you get so many different shades of shadows in one place, but sometimes you only need ONE specific color and not the entire palette. So does anyone have any ideas which brands or stores carry individual shadows?"

355,Makeup,Fuss-less mascaras and dark undereye cures?,"I am in a total mascara rut and just can't find something to try and wading through drugstore mascaras is just so hit and miss. I wanted to see if anyone here might be able to suggest something. I'm currently using Saie mascara and it's not bad, I like that it comes off clean but I'd like to try something that gives a little more oomph. Something that comes off clean but won't leave panda eyes since I think I have oily lids? 

The second product I'm looking for I could use some advice on. My undereyes are darker because I've had perpetual sleep problems for years now, and also have deeper natural creases under them. I have really good skin so I don't usually use concealer but the times I have I find it ineffective or too gummy to work with. Is there a good medium coverage concealer or maybe a powder would work better?

If any of y'all have ideas for either of these I'd be so so so grateful. Thanks!"

Can you guys help me find some products based on my concealer?,"I am currently wearing Sephora's Best Skin Ever T22 shade concealer I believe it's called and it matches my skin really well, after trying concealer i want to do more things to improve my appearance, i want to start contouring, i have yet to buy a foundation and concealer and the highlight thing people use when contouring, what products should i buy based on my concealer shade?

359,Makeup,"Having difficulty choosing good shades of eyeshadow (cool summer, deep set eyes)","I have warm hair with cool skin and deep set blue eyes. I guess I'd be considered a cool summer.

Generally speaking, overly warm colors for lipstick or blush seem to be overwhelming. Magentas and cool pinks seem to work pretty well for my skin tone.

My eyes are a different story. Bright warm tones reduce the darkness on my inner eye, but somehow they just seem a little blah. Cool tones make me seem tired, especially if I use them on my inner eye or under my eye.

So far what I've had best luck with brown on my outer eye and golden shimmer on my inner eye. This works, but I'm wondering if there are any other colors that could work well for me.

Is there anything I can do, or am I better off just embracing neutral browns and gold shimmers?"

I looked myself but considering the number of videos I thought maybe it's better to ask. I'm specifically looking for:

- how to make different types of lines with eyeliner
- how to use eyeshadow in more than a basic way (if I do, I apply primer, then 'try' to play with tones on my eyelid, not always successful...)
- how to contour my face

If that's any help, I'm 29 (F) with long, wavy brown hair and fair complexion. I have no skin issues except for slightly enlarged pores on my nose. My eyes are quite small and my nose needs some 'thinning'."

365,Makeup,Charlotte Tilbury Question,"So, I'm job hunting in the coming weeks. My field has tons of openings so there's likely going to be several sets of in person interviews (my employer's competitors are all basically in the same geographic location). That said the last time I interviewed I was 25, fresh faced, straight out of grad school, and idealistic. 

Now at 32, I'm in the final stages of a cancer battle (I'm definitely winning), jaded about the job/career field, and just generally more mature skin wise. 

I never really did makeup before but chemo has made me look like death slightly warmed over, so that's going have to change. 

I broke out of my shell and talked to an acquaintance whose makeup I admire and asked if I could buy her coffee and lunch in exchange for a trip to Sephora and Ulta to get some makeup and to help color match some foundation because I can't do it to save my life. She enthusiastically agreed and warned me that makeup, good makeup, wasn't cheap and asked my budget. I gave it to her and this morning we went shopping. 

Now I admit, perhaps I should not have told her my max budget of $300, but I'd done some surfing around and she was right , makeup wasn't cheap, and I had no idea what was good and what wasn't. 

We ended up finding a really good color match with Charlotte Tilbury at Sephora and we built from there. 

All in all we got:
- CT Hollywood Flawless Filter in Fair No. 2
- CT The Queen of Glow Eyeshadow Palette 
- CT Cheek to Chic Swish and Pop Blusher in Ecstasy 
- CT Flimstar Bronze and Glow Contour and Highlighter Palette in Light - Medium
- CT 34 mL Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray
- CT Airbrush Bronzer in Medium No. 2
- Tarte Creaseless Concealer in 10B, fair beige

Total Cost $277 or $39.60ish per item 

So I've gathered Charlotte Tilbury is definitely on the pricier end of makeup, but I was honestly more concerned about the ""look,"" for the first major foray. 

She spent the better part of today picking out makeup with me and and teaching me how to do it. The only thing we didn't do were brows because: 1) my eyebrows need waxed badly, 2) we never found a good shade match, and 3) we ran out of time after six hours. We both had a blast and we agreed to meet up next weekend for brunch so yay for new friends. 

So, I know being a newbie my makeup won't last as long while I figure out the right amounts to dispense &amp; apply, etc., but roughly how fast should I be running through these products if I do M-F makeup application? I might be able to justify the pricing a bit more if the make up lasts longer than it looks in the tiny bottles. Are there any good Charlotte Tilbury dupes in the states? Most of what I've seen has been Primark."
366,Makeup,any recommendations on how to keep your eyes from watering?,"I'm unsure if this is a personal medical issue, but this only happens when I apply eye makeup. Doing eye liner is difficult, I have hooded eyes so it usually smudges so to prevent that I go really close to the lash line but it makes my eyes water. The corner of my eyes (where you do 'wings' with eyeliner) is a really vulnerable spot too. Mascara is a hassle to do. Eyeshadow seems to be the safest, but rubs off easily due to my eyelids.

Applying lash adhesive and putting on eyelashes is the most hardest task. my eye shape is more rounded and the eyelashes I use tend to immediately fall off or not apply the right way no matter how hard I try.

I usually tend to avoid makeup tutorials because of my attention span, but if you have simple videos to recommend, much is appreciated."

375,Makeup,Palette Review &amp; Pictorial - Iconic London: Sunset to Sunrise Palette,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!] 

‚úÖ¬† Saturday Palette Review &amp; Pictorial ü§ì 

...... 

‚û°Ô∏è NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

üî∫Ô∏è PALETTE: Iconic London - Sunset to Sunrise Palette‚úå 

...... 

üî∫Ô∏è ACQUIRED: received in a BoxyCharm, of which I purchased myself 

...... 

üî∫Ô∏è SELECTION RATIONALE: I've had this palette in my collection for quite a bit, but never really thoroughly explored it! I wanted to play with it a little bit today. 

...... 

üëÅ LOOK CREATED: 'Sunset Eye' 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: each pan holds 1.6g of product, rectangular-shaped pans, rose gold mirrored chromatic cardboard packaging, bi-fold, palette brand is on cover, luxe-weight, magnetic closure system, square shape, mid-size mirror inside, tried a heavy magnet &amp; pans are NOT removable, shade nomenclature is designated to the immediate south of each shade 


üîä NOTICE: 

+ At 1.6g, the shadows weigh ABOVE the average amount per pan. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: this particular palette was made in China, but the version you purchase from their website is typically made in Italy 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è TOTAL # OF SHADES: 20 (all eyeshadows, which are deemed safe by the FDA for use around the eye area). Upon further evaluation, NONE of the included shades stained my skin. 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è TYPES OF FORMULAS: 2 formulas (8 mattes, 12 shimmers) 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è DESIGNATION: warm color-story 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: soft; recommend doing eyes before base with this palette.¬† 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è EXTRA PERTINENT INFORMATION: the creative inspiration behind this palette is the summer season, description states that there are 'glitters' in this palette, but I couldn't find any 

...... 

‚úÖ ROUTINE DATA CHECK: 

+ not clarified as being a clean formula 
+ cruelty-free (PETA-certified)
+ vegan 
+ 12-month PAO (located on palette) 

...... 

üîç COST EVALUATION: (Amazon) 

+ üí≤ $19.86 / palette 
+ üí≤ $0.99 / shade 
+ üí≤ $0.62 / gram 

...... 

‚ô¶Ô∏è PRICE PER SHADE SCALE: 

+ &lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


‚Ä¢ Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'extremely excellent'. Additionally - this palette has an 'amazing' cost-per-gram, as compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed. 

...... 

üîé REVIEW: 


üî∏Ô∏èPATCHINESS: none 

üî∏Ô∏èCREASING: yes; almost immediately after look was completed 

üî∏Ô∏èSTAINING: none 

üî∏Ô∏èBLENDABILITY: very easy to blend 

üî∏Ô∏èKICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ the matte shades had an extraordinary level of kick-back, but not the shimmers
+ experienced a ton of fall-out 


üî∏Ô∏èCOLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


‚Ä¢ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There is only one option available to create depth in your look, which drastically limits the palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create) 


‚Ä¢ realized that there was a lot of redundancy amongst the shimmers. The nuances between such minor shade subtleties are hardly noticeable in an overall look 


‚Ä¢ there are a few neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. I am unsure how they will fare on a range on skintones


‚Ä¢ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 8:12 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 40% / 60% formula split shows that it's leaning heavily 'shimmer-y'. I prefer either completely balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy


‚Ä¢ I consider this to be a 'warm-toned' color-story, and it's not unique to my collection in the slightest. I do particularly like the entire layout of this palette 


‚Ä¢ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'


‚Ä¢ there were no 'dud' shades in this palette


‚Ä¢ there is not any decorative embossing on any of the included shadows 

...... 

üî∏Ô∏èFORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

üîπÔ∏è | MATTES |: 

+ the mattes are SUPER powdery in all aspects (I prefer a powdery formula)
+ some of the mattes have tiny pinpoint glitter specks in them, but they perform just as a normal matte shadow
+ I found this formula easy to blend
+ each color applied to my eyes the same as it appears as in the pan
+ this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula 

// 

üîπÔ∏è | SHIMMERS |: 

+ EXTREMELY cream-like in texture 
+ different levels of shimmers - some provide a slight shimmer, while others are intensely foiled 
+ there is both a mix of sheer &amp; pigmented bases - each shade is different 
+ attempted all application methods - my finger, a dry brush, &amp; a dampened brush. It worked exactly the same using all methods. 

...... 

üî∏Ô∏èPACKAGING: 


+ I am partial to the cosmetic look of mirrored chromatic packaging - ESPECIALLY that of the rose gold variety. This palette looks luxurious and expensive, and it feels that way in the hands 

+ I think this packaging is an excellent representation of the brand (Iconic London), as it is completely in-line with other products offered in their range and collection. 

...... 

üî∏Ô∏èCOMMENTARY: guys, I'm having a REALLY hard time right now - I'm on 'Day 4' of my sugar detox, and I'm going through withdrawal from a very addictive medication all at the same time. I'm getting INTENSE headaches, feel immensely fatigued, feel dizzy af, and basically don't feel like doing anything. If you are reading this, and YOU are one of those people that really likes giving me a hard time over my eyeshadow looks - just let it pass gently today, okay? I'm suffering bad enough, and tried my best (given the circumstances). 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏èFINAL RECOMMENDATION: (recommend) 

+ very easy to blend
+ fun and safe shade selection
+ beautiful display palette 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Summer Glow
- Least Favorite Shade: Ultraviolet 

...... 

üö¶ RATING: B 

...... 

‚≠ê RATING LEGEND: 

+ A = totally wow'd me
+ B = not the best, but I like it
+ C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product
+ D = this didn't work out for me
+ F = I totally hate this

376,Makeup,Where/how to start learning how to do makeup,"Hi, I'm a teenager who wants to learn how to do makeup, but I have no idea where to start or how to learn. I have a few questions, but literally any advice is welcomed.
1. Are there any YouTube channels or something that you recommend for learning?
2. Where can I get decent makeup for somewhat cheap? I don't have much money (cons of being a teen lmao), but I have some. I would go to Walmart, but I saw a video that said Walmart was really bad for makeup
3. Where do I even start with makeup? I have basically no makeup, but there's just so many different things used for makeup Idek where to start
4. This isn't a question, but if anyone could tell me everything that I need to get started (idk, brushes or stuff?)
Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!"
377,Makeup,How do I prevent my base makeup from making my sebum more apparent?,"I was hoping to get some help with how I should be approaching base makeup application (or anything else that may be the root of this issue). I noticed that I'm never able to get a nice, uniform layer of foundation in the areas between my eyebrows, the sides of my nose, and my temples. Little sebum dots will always show through and they look worse than when I wasn't wearing any foundation at all.

I think I have combination skin since I form dry patches around my nose but the rest of my face gets pretty oily throughout the day. Lately, I have been using the elf poreless putty primer and the NARS radiant longwear foundation for my base; my skin prep before that is washing my face with the inkey list oat cleansing balm, lancome tonique confort hydrating facial toner, and then using the innisfree jelly cream. I have been using the ordinary's AHA + BHA peeling solution once a week for about 3 weeks now. I like to blend the foundation in using a beauty blender, and I did notice that the NARS foundation blends in slightly better‚Äîon occasion‚Äîwhen I use my hands, but I do get some streakiness from this application method too."

385,Makeup,I look ill without makeup even when well. What can I do?,"I know it's a common problem to look ill w/o makeup if you wear it very regularly, but I wear a full face of makeup once a week at most.

Some days I look fresh and glowy, but other ones (like today) my skin looks kind of grey, sallow and blotchy, and my lips are pale, for no apparent reason. I feel fine - I eat well, sleep enough, drink plenty of water and exercise. I also use retinoids on prescription as an acne treatment which have been exfoliating my skin. I'm not sure what could be going on. Might it be hormonal? 

Other than finding potential causes, is there a way to brighten up my face without using makeup, perhaps by a skincare technique or something else? Any advice is much appreciated."

Has the cartridge changed in the last two years, making a new refill not compatible for the old applicator? Or am I just missing something?

393,Makeup,How to prime and set cream-to-powder foundation,"I have oily, acne-prone skin and have had decent luck with cream foundations for full coverage in the past, so I'm probably going to buy a cream-to-powder foundation ([Milani Conceal + Perfect](https://www.ulta.com/p/conceal-perfect-smooth-finish-cream-powder-foundation-pimprod2012993) is the only one that I can find that isn't absurdly expensive). However, I don't know what kind of primer I should use under such a foundation and I especially don't know what I should use to set it. I'm concerned that powder on top of powder might dry out my skin and make it more oily (which has happened in the past), but also that setting spray might not ""set"" anything at all. Do any of you use cream-to-powder foundation and what do you use to set it?

Also, bonus question: can I use a beauty blender to apply the foundation? I had pretty good results with beauty blenders before, although that was with a CC cream/tinted moisturizer and not an actual foundation."
394,Makeup,discontinued line,"Hey, so I own this lip liner, I have no idea how it came into my possession. It must have been a gift or something. But, it is my favorite lip liner and the color is just perfect. I cannot find another one like it, the thing is, I went to find it on the internet to see if I could buy another one but no search results for lip liners would come up, i'm not sure what happened to this brand and it seems like there's no answers online about it either. The name of the product is Rialto, the shade burnt terracotta.

If anyone has any idea about this brand please let me know, I am curious :)"

396,Makeup,(PLEASE HELP) Foundation recommendations for combination skin while using acne topicals,"**Backstory (feel free to skip to the bottom to get a quick summary):**

I have an extreme case of combination skin. My skin is acne-prone, very sensitive, dry (eczema), and oily (genetically). I've had a few dermatologists over the past decade, for my acne and eczema, and love the one I've been seeing for the past couple years. I've always used topical acne treatments at night but with the help of my current dermatologist I've also been using a daytime topical for acne.

Although I love the progress my skin has made while using a daytime topical, it has made my makeup look disgusting. **Literally disgusting**. Foundations refuse to stick to certain parts of my face, the makeup pills up on my jawline/hairline, my face looks cakey/patchy/dry. I only wear makeup once in a blue moon to feel more confident, but end up feeling insecure. 

**Does anyone know of any foundations that work well with acne topicals?** *Also here are the other skincare products I use before applying foundation: CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion, MDSolarSciences Mineral Cream SPF 50, Milk Hydro grip primer.*"
397,Makeup,"Pale, blue eyes and light brown hair - struggling to find flattering lip products","I'm pale with blue eyes and light brown hair. I find it difficult to wear much colour on my lips as it doesn't seem to suit me, but after getting bored of wearing Dior Lip Glow everyday I thought I'd try buy a few lip products to experiment. 

I first bought the Mac Faux lipstick as it's cool toned and I'd seen it look really pretty on others with my kind of colouring, but on me it looks way too pale and pink. I then bought the Maybelline Lifter Gloss in the shade Petal and I like that colour if I sheer it out a little bit, but it has quite thick gold glitter in which I don't like. I was surprised I liked it as it's a little more red and darker then I thought I would like. I then bought the Nars Afterglow lip balm in Dolce Vita which I really like, again it's more of a red/rosy kind of colour but it seems to balance out my features and looks like my lips but better. I really like the way the Dolce Vita looks but I'm looking for someone with a little more pigment, ideally not matte.

Can anyone recommend me some other products to try are similar to Nars Dolce Vita Afterglow lip balm."
398,Makeup,How to conceal dark spot on lips,"Hi guys. I have spot on the edge of my lip that causes that spot to be a noticeably darker shade of pink than the rest of my lips. 

I've tried to find tutorials on how to cover it up, but most just suggest putting skin-tone concealer on, which isn't really what I'm going for. I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to cover up the mark and make it the same shade as the rest of my lips?"
399,Makeup,Perfect Nudey-Brown Lipstick,"Hi everyone!! I'm looking for a brown in the nude family if that makes any sense, but I still want it to come across brown, not orange or pink. 

I'm extremely fair, literally think of the lightest shade in any foundation and that's me, with medium cool brown hair and grey eyes. Don't know if that matters but just in case. I have fairly neutral undertones that skew a tad on the warmer side. 

I've tried But First Coffee from the Sephora Collection and that one is okay but is a tad too warm I think. And I've tried NYX XXL Lip Lingerie in Goin Desnuda and that pulls so dark it looks black. 

Any suggestions? I would prefer a matte liquid lipstick but am open to other formulas if it's the right color."
400,Makeup,"Hey ladies, can I stock up on mascaras and have them not dry out?",So I‚Äôve found a German brand (Catrice) that makes great and cheap mascaras which I wanted to stock up on. Only I am wondering if I can buy several of them and store them unopened without them drying out?
401,Makeup,Should I be wearing foundation to protect my skin?,"Before the pandemic I was wearing foundation basically every day (usually Too Faced's Born This Way). But once I stopped needing to go out I thought I'd give my skin a break. At first my skin hated it! I was breaking out more than ever and couldn't tie it to doing anything different other than not wearing foundation. But after a transition period I felt like my skin was consistently clearer than ever. When I started to occasionally go out again and put on foundation, after removing it I felt like my skin looked even more dull and gray than before putting the make up on, even though I carefully removed all of it. 

I now wear a tinted sunscreen in place of foundation. I thought not wearing foundation would just be better for my skin. But I've have read online that wearing a layer of make-up/foundation can help protect against damage from free radicals, pollution, sun, etc. Are these claims true? 

I recently turned 30 and want to up my skincare game, so I'm debating whether incorporating foundation back into my routine would be better for my skin if I'm wearing one with clean ingredients and removing it properly. On the other hand it's been nice not to deal with since I hate the feeling of foundation and the look of anything other than very light coverage. I've also considered BB or CC creams instead but I have tried so many brands and they all break me out or sit weirdly on my skin. Any advice on this?"

404,Makeup,Advice for Mature Skin + Hyperpigmentation,"When working on mature, aging skin with sun damage, hyperpigmentation, dark spots etc. it always helps to substitute full coverage products for color correcting. Always prep skin well, and apply a color complementary to the shade of the blemish you want to neutralize, before foundation. It's helpful if your corrector has built-in coverage, like the graftobian glamour creme corrector palettes. (they come in a fair, and deep color way). If you still require more coverage after correction, try using a full coverage creme pigment like the kevyn aucoin sensual skin enhancer, only over the areas you've corrected. I did bridal makeup on a mature client recently and utilized these techniques, then applied a medium coverage, natural dewy finish foundation on top (dior forever skin glow). This ensured that her skin was perfected but that the glam looked flattering in most lighting. you can also build coverage when setting the face, by setting with a foundation powder i.e. mac studio fix powder, onesize turn up the base powder, urban decay stay naked the fix, etc."

So far I've used the honest beauty mascara, one by burst bees, Covergirl lash blast, and Maybelline the falsies. The Covergirl one has been my favorite so far. I do not like the Maybelline one (which is what I have right now.) I want a good mascara that doesn't clump and looks super natural. Under $15 would be nice. My lashes are super straight so I use a cheap eyelash curler from target but I want a better one (also under $10 or $15.) Usually, my lashes don't hold a curl so I need a mascara that helps with that too. What does everyone recommend? Also if I can find this at Target that would be great, I have a gift card."

438,Makeup,My eyebrows are always too dark!,"I'm 24 years old, I have a medium brown complexion (Mexican heritage), and very dark brown hair. When I was a preteen, I over plucked my  brows because I wanted them to look like Jenna Fischer's (Pam) in season 1 of The Office. It has been tragic ever since. My brows have never fully grown back. The tails of my brows are almost non existent, and they are thinner than they should be because I severely over plucked them on the bottom. 

This being said, I have to fill them in every day in order to look normal. But because of how sparse they are, I'm always way too heavy handed. My brows hairs naturally grown downard, and it's literally not possible for me to make them ""stand up"" (like feather brows). I've tried pencils, pomades, and powders, and yet my brows always come out too dark because of how much product I need to use in order to get a clean shape. 

Looking at childhood photos of myself,  my natural brows appear grey-colored compared to my black hair. And that seemed to suit my face a lot more. I'm wondering if there's a brown product out there that can help me achieve that same affect, i.e. light in color but pigmented enough for me to get a clean shape on my sparse brows.

458,Makeup,Centre of attention makeup.,"Okay, so Instagram algorithm found a someone for me to follow maybe 2yrs ago now, pretty cool content, pretty cool gal.
Her names Courtney hollins, aka Centre of attention make up artisty.
Let me begin by saying i liked her, I liked how she'd say things, being from New Zealand it's cool to see a auzzy getting up there, she had good product reviews, all around she's a little rough around the edges but that's just the kiwi auzzy personalitys.
The other night Courtney makes a post, with a screen cap of someone's Facebook for all of her followers to see (low-key really wishing is screenshoted her post myself kinda hoping maybe one off you have üòÖ) she's calling this lady out for commenting shitty stuff on her posts and just being a generalized menace.
So i commented, jist of my comment was the post was shitty and you don't know what crazies follow you, pretty much immediately the post gets taken down, which was the optimal outcome imo.
But that's not quite what happened, the post got reported until it got taken down, and then Courtney did a live stream, explaining why she blocked everyone who didn't agree with her posting someone's Facebook account for all off her followers to see. So to her, just because she's got a following why does that mean she's not aloud to stick up for herself? (Which i agree with, stand up for yourself, don't post screencaps knowing full well your minions are about to go harass ol aunty dolmio yaknow.) 
The entire problem, is not the the fact she stood up for herself, it's that she thinks she's done nothing wrong in this situation.
So im asking myself why im writing this, and the entire reason is keep an eye on this girl, she's going to be the next Jeffree Star.

I have pretty curly hair and my eyelashes do have a slight curl to them naturally, like, my lashes aren‚Äôt dead straight.

I've tried moving away from mascara unless I was full glam so I‚Äôve tried two clear mascaras (Maybelline and Essence) and the formula is just too wet and takes too long to dry, by the time it does the formula has already flopped the curl.

521,Makeup,Question!,"Hi, I have a question.

We are currently fundraising on Kickstarter. 

We created a new service that offers an unlimited eyeshadow color exchange service.

Sounds complicated? It is because we are the first company who are trying this.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the process:

1) Build Your Own Palette (Get 9 single eyeshadows + 1 free gift (eyelash, eyeliner, eyebrow pencil, etc)

2) Request exchange (Get 4 more single eyeshadows for free + 1 free gift: only pay shipping cost)

3) Repeat this process until the warranty period is over.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought this is an amazing idea, but it seems not many people are interested in this idea. Would you guys tell me why this is less attractive for makeup lovers?

553,Makeup,Help! At a loss - runny eyes due to make up.,"Hey, so reaching out to see if anyone has any advice. 
Long story short, while I was on maternity leave I didn't wear mascara or eye liner too much. Then when I started to go out and work more often, putting mascara on, my eyes would have a reaction to the make up, runny and red, which just ruins the rest of your make up. I switched to sensitive mascara, vegan friendly etc you name it, I have tried it. 

I generally have oily skin &amp; lids and this probably doesn't help. It's wearing me out now. I have started a new job and spent the day on and off with my eyes stinging and running. I can laugh about it but it's frustrating. 

I also have hooded lids so eye liner and mascara helps with making my eyes look bigger and wider when done right, so not having anything makes me feel self conscious at times. 

- Lash tinting hasn't worked for me in the past.

- I'd love eye lash extensions but 1. Costly regularly for me atm &amp; 2 glue on eye lashes long term not advised.

- Magnetic eyelashes - doesn't work for me either. Generally found that you need alot of the eye liner for them to stay, which I don't wear alot and doesn't sit well on my very oily lids.

I have also tried lots of eye primers but not have helped the situations. 

Also bought multiple products and used them straight away for them to run the same day, so it's not old make up. 


Does anyone have any suggestions? Someone suggested seeing an eye specialist too - would they find anything that would enlighten me. Do I have to suck it up and just deal with the fact I have sensitive eyes? Anyone that can offer any advise on this or suffer the same, I'd love to hear what you gotta say!

586,Makeup,struggling to find a foundation that fit my skin.,"I feel like when it comes to adding foundation to your skin is quite easy likewise with adding concealer and maybe contour. it's just base (foundation/ which is your skin tone), highlight (concealer, to lighten spots on your face where light regularly lay on), and contour used as a shadow. 

I hope I'm right with this... 

At first I was wondering why I was struggling with it but then I realise the foundation doesn't fit my face. I don't know how to test one of the products to know what color fits me but the darker foundation is too dark for my face. Yes I am dark skin but my face have an orange tone so it's like a mix.

597,Makeup,WARNING!!! CULTBEAUTY IS A SCAM!!!!,"It's an amazingly ridiculous shopping experience with u/cultbeauty .

[https://www.cultbeauty.com/](https://www.cultbeauty.com/) 

I ordered a package worth more than 300$ from Cultbeauty and ship to Singapore. 

The package arrived in Singapore on the 10th of May; then, the DPD website kept showing: ""Your parcel is being processed through customs, pending the payment of duties and taxes. "" Then I wrote to the CB team asking for advice because generally in Singapore, the local delivery company will deal with the payment then collect from us.  

Well, I didn't expect to open a communication black hole that would suck all my questions and lead the conversation to become an intellectual battle with the AI from the Cultbeauty team. They hold onto one notion - You have to help yourself‚Äîno support from Cultbeauty or their delivery company. You need to call local customs and find the right local service providers from thousands of local delivering companies. (If you are interested, you can DM me for the conversation feed. Warning, it will cost high-level irritation.)

The funny thing is, I did find a way to hop on a call with the officer from the Singapore Customs. He warned me that this company might be a scam. 

So, to whoever wants to buy from them, remember my experience. Cultbeauty will take your money and politely tell you to fuck off."

I am also running low on my sunscreen so I figured I would look into a primer and sunscreen that would compliment the NARS foundation.

1. I haven't been able to find if the NARS foundation is water-based or oil-based, but I assume a hydrating/gripping primer would probably be the best? I've tried a sample of the Smashbox  
Photo Finish Primerizer+ Hydrating Face Primer and liked it, but i've also heard good things about the Milk Hydrogrip Primer. Any recommendations?

So, I have really big pores and, as a result, I tend to avoid foundation.

Luckily, my skincare is good enough that I can go without foundation and still look okay.

The trouble is that my skincare products make me look really shiny. I dislike it a lot. I feel like I appear greasy. I'd like to make my skin more matte. I've tried translucent finishing powders, but these powders settle into my pores and end up looking awful. 

What can I do to make my face less shiny? Thanks!"

However, I am starting to wonder if I really need that base because I have seen some women wear concealer without foundation, and their faces looked great.

+ Total Products I'm Keeping: 11
+ Total Products I'm Decluttering: 3
+ Total Products I'm Repurchasing: 1
+ % of Routine Fully Used/Decluttered: 25% 


‚Ä¢ DECLUTTERED PRODUCTS: will be placed in a special box for the time being as I collect more, but I intend on gathering a few more over time, and selling (the ones I paid for) as a bundle for solely the cost of shipping on my boutique. The products that I got for free will be bundled together and I will hold a bundle giveaway for people who don't mind (sanitized) secondhand products used only by me. 


‚Ä¢ PROS OF THIS SYSTEM: significant product knowledge, ability to get intensively creative with products, easy to manage such a small grouping of products, no hard decisions on what makeup to wear every day, means to actually use up products (or make a pretty big dent)


‚Ä¢ CONS OF THIS SYSTEM: boredom (I got notably bored at the three-week mark), if something you pick really sucks - you have to explore ways to make it work in other capacities, sadness of potentially decluttering something you spent a lot of money on if it doesn't perform

üîî SELECTED REVIEWS (full reviews on each product used + a complete 'try-on' are already uploaded on my YouTube channel) 


‚ñ™Ô∏èPRIMER: Veil Cosmetics - Sunset Light Primer Serum ‚Ä¢ this is such an interesting and unique type of bottle; I love how satisfying it is to see exactly how much I've been using. Each time I've used this, I've found that three pumps was the perfect amount. This primer has absolutely no scent. It gives my skin the most PERFECT sunlit glow - it looks like a strong luminous primer without having any sparkly chunks or obnoxious shine. This primer has worked perfectly along with every other product I've used alongside it. It immediately absorbs into my skin and provides for a very smooth finish without that silicone-like, slippery feeling.

‚ñ™Ô∏èEYE PRIMER: Sample Beauty - Erase &amp; Boost Base ‚Ä¢ the best thing about this is that you get a MEGA amount in the pot! Unfortunately, it smells like baby powder - but the scent doesn't translate once you actually apply it. I used to LOVE this when I first got it, but the more I've been using it - my disdain has grown. On the good side, just a little teeny bit goes such a long way, it fully color corrects any harsh discoloration, and it truly provides for a full-coverage base. Sadly, as I apply it, it starts going on 'patchy', and leaving some spots more hydrated and others very, very dry - making for the shadows on top to look very odd and uneven. ALSO - this primer severely creases on me.

‚ñ™Ô∏èCONCEALER: The Cr√®me Shop - Full Coverage Concealer ‚Ä¢ off the top, this has a HORRIBLE, barely tolerable, strong paint-like scent to it. Every time I utilized it like a 'normal' undereye concealer - it LOOKED extremely flawless, but it burned the hell out of my eyes and caused them to turn red and severely water. After narrowing it down to THIS product, I completely stopped using it as an undereye concealer, but found it looks absolutely magical when used as a foundation base product OR as a facial spot concealer. As a foundation base, I apply a few 'x's' all over my face, and it blends-out flawlessly with a brush. It gives me the perfect coverage, and it doesn't look heavy or cakey in the least! As a spot concealer, it works wonders and lasts all day long. I do enjoy setting it with a bit of powder, as it does have a bit of a tacky-feeling.

‚ñ™Ô∏èSETTING POWDER: OPV Beauty - Loose Setting Powder ‚Ä¢ overall, I just haven't had any luck with this powder whatsoever. I've tried every possible way to apply it - with a sponge, a large fluffy brush, a more precise flimsy brush, and a velour puff. No matter which way I apply it, the final result is always a heavy, cakey, messy look that creases on me, making my face look several years older. This powder collects into my most porous areas on my face, giving me a white-cast that doesn't disappear. On a good note, there's no scent to it, and the plastic dispenser partition is excellent in its construction. I love the IDEA of this powder, but its actual performance has been less-than-impressive.

‚ñ™Ô∏èEYESHADOW PALETTE: Revolution Beauty - Reloaded ‚Ä¢ the more I've used this over the course of the month, the more I've been ABSOLUTELY loving it. It has served as a multipurpose product for the eyes, lips, and face. After getting creative with it, I was able to pull-off some of the shades as amazing face and lip products. The shades and textures incororated into this palette are so excellent - I cannot believe people are skipping on this! I seriously want to buy more 'Reloaded' palettes to see if the formula is consistent throughout the range. Each eye look that I've done with it, I have truly loved, and have had so much fun with. I was able to get a quick and easy look OR take it to the extreme with a dramatic, fancy look. You get a great shade selection in here, and some very interesting effects. This was my most-favorite piece that I've experienced all month long. The only 'con' I would like to make note of, is that the saturated black ink on the front of the palette has begun to rub off onto my hands, causing me angst.

‚ñ™Ô∏èBROWS: Iconic London - Brow Silk ‚Ä¢ this is such an interesting product, and I truly believe it to be one of the pioneer products for many of the similar ones we see on the market today. I found it best to use this BEFORE I did any of my other makeup, as the wax would remove any foundation around the brow area. As per the instructions - I tried using it both wet and dry, and preferred its operational ability when the wax was in its dry state. I used its companion 'toothbrush-looking tool', and I also attempted to use the wax with a spoolie. Overall, the 'toothbrush-tool' was much more effective with this particular formula. I initially applied the wax by back-combing my brow and ensuring the wax fully and evenly coated the entire eyebrow. Then, I went for the feathery look, and fluffed my eyebrow up a pinch. After I was done applying the rest of my makeup, both eyebrows totally fell. This wax doesn't have ANY hold to it at all. Upon touch, my brows felt very waxy and almost wet. I wouldn't recommend this for any sort of 'laminated look' - in fact, I wouldn't recommend this at all.

+ WAS ANYTHING MISSING FROM MY ROUTINE? yes; a setting spray, a color-corrector, and a pore-filling primer 


+ DID I FEEL AS IF I HAD A SURPLUS AMOUNT OF ANY PRODUCT? no 


+ DID I MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE INITIAL MAKEUP ROUTINE SELECTION? yes; I added a highlighter on 'Week 3' as I completely forgot to initially include one. I don't have quite enough knowledge on the formula to extensively review it. 


+ WHAT THINGS 'DON'T COUNT'? I don't necessarily include various colored eyeliners (I pick one to focus on for the month, but I'm not limited to ONLY that one for every look), lip pencils, assistance mascaras, lashes, prep items, or lip plumpers

657,Makeup,where to find good colored liquid eyeliners?,"one of my absolute favorite things to play with is really bright, colorful, neon liquid eyeliners! but besides the basic colors or a few metallic shades, i can‚Äôt find any! 

i love NYX and they have some cute ones (i have their white, fuchsia metal, lilac, sapphire epic wear liners + the vivid bright baby pink and vivid fire!)- but i want to find a wide range of bright or pastel ones! 
i bought CmaaDU‚Äôs 10 pack (i think) of liners from amazon. i love them but once they dry, they sometimes will start to peel or i have to put on a few layers b/c they can look streaky.

658,Makeup,Foundation recs for hotter weather?,"Hi all,

Does anyone have any recommendations for foundation now that it's getting warmer here in the US? It could be foundation, bb cream, skin tint or whatever. I've been interested in Giorgio Armani silk foundation, Fenty eaze skin tint, and Nars light reflecting.

I have big pores and oily skin. Mild acne that comes and goes but not a major concern. I mainly look for something that just helps even out my skin color and can really last all day. 

I've been using Estee Lauder's double wear but I'm not sure why lately (now that it's warmer... I'm guessing it might be due to weather?) when I've been doing my foundation and then setting it with my usual Laura Mercier translucent powder, it gets patchy, ugly and doesn't blend well. The patchiness also happened today when I tried setting my face after using Missha's red tube BB cream. Anyone know why? I like using setting powder since I don't like that sticky feeling from wet foundation on my face. Would changing to setting spray be better? I've been looking into getting Urban Decay's all nighter after seeing many posts recommending that. How long does it take for the UD setting spray to dry down your face so it's not wet/sticky?

Do people just deal with the sticky feeling on their face? How long does your makeup take to dry down  in general?

What else could I change in my routine to stop the patchiness from happening? I take good care of my skin daily so I don't think it's a problem with skincare.

On a side note, somewhat related... Does anyone know why good coverage of SPF is not common in western beauty? In Kbeauty there's always atleast 30+SPF in all their face base products. I was just thinking maybe it would be nice to find a foundation that also has SPF already so I know it will mix well with each other."

664,Makeup,Seeking Opinions: Similar product finish to E.L.F. Matte Eyeshadow (liquid),"The finish of e.l.f.'s matte eyeshadow (link to a Walmart listing below) was \~perfection\~. I have been seeking a liquid to matte finish eyeshadow, and have been very disappointed with market options. The o.g. is discontinued, active listings I highly suspected are old/expired and are more than the original MSRP.  

Things I have tried:

* E.L.F No Budge Shadow Stick - I think it doesn't apply easily and doesn't have the same finish.
* E.L.F. Shadow Lock Eyelid Primer - I find that this creases and does not work well with shadows overtop (turns colors gray and prevents quality blending)
* E.L.F. Liquid Glitter- Fine, but no matte option
* Ulta Brand  Matte Cream Eyeshadow - doesn't have the same quality finish once it dries and shadows do not blend well over top
* M.A.C. Pro Longwear Paint Pot Eyeshadow - for the price point, I still prefer the E.L.F. and not impressed with the dry down and how shadows work overtop
* Wet N Wild Megalast Liquid Catsuit Creme Eyeshadow - doesn't have the same quality finish once it dries and shadows do not blend well over top

665,Makeup,Clear band false lash recommendations and brands?,"Does anyone have any recommendations for false lash brands that use clear bands?

696,Makeup,Foundation makes me look old!,"Hi everyone, üíï

does anyone else have the problem that foundation is making them look old? ü§Øüò§

I am female and just turned 40. I would say, in general, I don‚Äôt look older than I am. I never smoked, I don‚Äôt drink, I avoid the sun and I always wear SPF 50, all the year round. Also, I would say I eat quite healthy.

I don‚Äôt use makeup on a daily basis anymore (currently on parental leave); mostly I only use moisturiser and sunscreen; sometimes a slightly tinted sunscreen on top. 

For some special occasions, I still like to wear some makeup. But lately I found that it makes me look soooo old - much older than I look without it imho. 

The problem is that my skin is very sensitive and lacks moisture, but at the same time it tends to get a bit oily, so I need to use powder to set the foundation, and I feel this is what is making me look old: the foundation &amp; powder collect in my wrinkles and make them appear more prominent than they seem without makeup. 

What can I do? I am just using the wrong products? 

As I said already, my skin is very sensitive. I have rosacea and can‚Äôt tolerate scented skincare products, and products that contain a lot of alcohol, since they will irritate my skin. I feel, this makes everything quite complicated, because most foundations contain perfume and/or alcohol. 

But maybe someone is in the same boat as me and has the ultimate recommendation which products might actually work? 

Thanks a lot in advance! ‚òÄÔ∏è"

However, I would like to get more into it and become more skillful at doing good quality makeup. Most make-up videos nowadays are a bit complicated for me to try and I'm also clueless when it comes to choosing the right products. What are some good learning sources which can teach me make-up from the basic level and make me more knowledgeable about it so that I know which product has what function and how to choose make-up products for myself?

712,Makeup,Beginner here: is buying foundation/primer necessary if my skin is already even/unblemished? What about setting powder?,"Hi there!  
I'm in high school, and prom is literally in less than a week. My goal is to look nice on camera and do some decent eye makeup. I'm a complete newbie though, so I'm not sure how much makeup I should be putting on my face. Especially if my complexion is already okay..

I just bought stuff yesterday: tinted moisturizer, two eyeshadow palettes, eyeliner pencil, eyebrow pencil, and setting powder. However, I'm wondering if I should return the powder if I only have tinted moisturizer. Would my eye makeup look weird if I don't use it?

I'd love any advice!!"

My problem is I have severe acne, dark eyes (not just eyebags, and lower face hyperpigmentation, which I do not want broadcasted. I know it sounds silly, but looking at my face in such a state really makes me sad, and this is a prestigious award. I've never done makeup before, but there are no nearby makeup artists and I need the photo soon. Is there any way to cover all, if not, most of my face as a beginner?"

718,Makeup,Eye makeup without face?,"Hi y‚Äôall. I got really out of the habit of consistent, full face makeup while I worked graveyard for several years. I then switched to swing and pretty much went with little to no makeup then too. Then with the pandemic and wearing masks, I didn‚Äôt even bother as I found the makeup under the mask getting smeared into my face while no one was going to see it anyway seemed silly. 

I finally got a day shift position this year. I have felt the need to start wearing makeup again. I‚Äôve been pretty excited about eyeshadow and lipstick even though I mostly feel I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. I try watching eyeshadow tutorials but I‚Äôm mostly just very confused. 

Anyway, what I‚Äôve noticed is that I find foundation and face powder extremely uncomfortable now when years ago I hated my skin so much that face powder was my favorite. I am wondering if it‚Äôs seen as inappropriate to wear just eye makeup (shadow and mascara or sometimes just mascara) and lipstick/lipgloss? Do people notice? I always wear some kind of serum/lotion/moisturizer so my skin isn‚Äôt completely naked. Maybe this is a stupid question but is it okay to go without foundation and powder when you‚Äôre using other kinds of makeup?"

730,Makeup,What are the best under eye setting powders?,"I‚Äôve noticed in the past 2 years that my under eyes crease a lot. I‚Äôm almost 27, dry skin, with fine lines under eyes. 

I have found that my under eyes look better without concealer as I don‚Äôt really need the coverage, dark circles aren‚Äôt a concern for me and I‚Äôve tried probably 30 concealers over the years and most just made my skin look old.

So I‚Äôll typically just lightly go over the under eye area with whatever foundation I‚Äôm using (I use foundations geared towards normal-dry skin) but I do have to set it with a powder because I will get insane creasing throughout the day. 

What are your favorite setting powders for the under eye area? And, if there‚Äôs a light weight concealer you absolutely love, and doesn‚Äôt crease much/if at all, what is it?

735,Makeup,Foundation oxidizing,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm about to give up on my makeup journey here. 

I have oily skin type. A bit of acne and redness but they are not too much of a concern. My concern is no matter how perfect of a shade my foundation or tinted moisturizers are, they oxidize on me.

I have medium/tan warm skintone and after a few minutes of applying product on my face it turns darker and Orange around my chin. 

I have tried several primer and foundation /tint/concealer combos and I always look like I applied a self tanner on my face. 

I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs and I have not committed to makeup in years. When I was in my early twenties I never had to worry about my foundation changing colors, so I find this problem absurd. I work in a customer service based job so I want to keep up my appearance more, but I am so close to giving up.

I bought a foundation mixing pigment that will lighten my foundation, so that once it oxidizes I was hoping it will be close to my skin color, but the problem is how orange my skin (especially my chin)  gets.

I‚Äôm also debating on buying foundations or tints that are 2 shades lighter, so that when it oxidize it will be closer to my skin color??? 

Even if I don‚Äôt get advice I wanted to see if anybody experienced the same as me? Def feel like I‚Äôm alone here"

I‚Äôm moving abroad at the end of the summer and can‚Äôt take them all with me in their original packaging due to space and weight so was thinking of somehow combining them into one palette. How easy is this to do? From my understanding you can either pop the pans out or break the product up and repress it. I‚Äôm a bit worried that the heat needed to take out the whole pan or the alcohol potentially needed to repot may impact the formula. Is this the case? Does anyone know what approach is the easiest and best to keep the formula the same? Any advice would be very much appreciated!"

763,Makeup,Treating my ADHD with makeup,"So I‚Äôm 37 I‚Äôve been wearing makeup for many many years but never once until recently attempted anything other than neutrals and eventually I stopped wearing anything outside of a little eyeliner until recently. 

Call it just another hyperfocus but let me just explain how I know this one is here to stay. I‚Äôve struggled my entire life and didn‚Äôt get diagnosed until 35 years old. Starting meds was literally life changing. And about 2 weeks ago I found that doing my makeup was almost as life changing. NOW this does not mean that I am suggesting to swap meds for makeup lol. 

For the last 3 years I struggled more than I had in my entire life. Ended up with an anxiety diagnosis along with OCD and ADHD. Unfortunately my OCD was the weird kind instead of the productive kind. 

Anyway. 

Even with my diagnosis I had to beg for treatment for my adhd because they were concerned it would make my anxiety worse. Big Surprise it got better. 

Life story out of the way‚Ä¶.about 3 weeks ago I started trying out the Curly Girl method because I suspected my hair texture changed after the baby. I was right and now my hair looks amazing. So my thought was it‚Äôs silly to have this great hair and nothing on my face lol. 

That‚Äôs what led me to take advantage of the babies nap time and start experimenting with eyeshadow pallets and really push the boundaries of what I‚Äôm comfortable with. I noticed that once I‚Äôve finished getting ready for the day I feel AMAZING. My mood is instantly better and I get everything done that I usually procrastinate on with no hesitation. 

I think what‚Äôs happening is that I‚Äôm prioritizing an hour to sometimes 2 hours to myself. It‚Äôs just me in a quiet space doing something that‚Äôs productive (rather than doom scrolling Reddit). That basically means I have an opportunity to hyperfocus on hygiene, have quiet time to collect my thoughts and plan out my day, and I get little shots of dopamine throughout the day when I glance at my makeup. 

Not to mention the combinations are limitless so I‚Äôll never get bored with it!

766,Makeup,Favorite Eyeshadow Palletes?,"I want to start trying some more fun eyeshadow looks to spice my makeup up and am looking for some pallet recommendations! I feel like I‚Äôve only gotten pretty good at eyeshadow recently so I only have 3 smaller pallets such as
* Covergirl Trunaked Sunshine Escape Eyeshadow Pallet
* Juvias Place The Violets Eyeshadow Palette
* Sephora Merry &amp; Bright Eyeshadow Pallet

767,Makeup,In Need of Incredibly Lazy-Girl Makeup,"Hi beauty cuties. I am a makeup-for-fun person, and might do a full face three times a year, but for a daily look, it's mascara and tinted lip balm. 

I am not well-versed in all the brands, types, etc, so I am hoping for some outside help!  I started a new full-time job, and I have sleep issues, so sometimes I wake up and look kind of...dead. I'm looking for a blush, maybe a stick-type, that I can just dab on and rub in with my fingers and an eyeshadow that I can also just smudge on with my fingers and go. If there's a blush that is also an eyeshadow, even better. I have executive functioning issues as well, so the easier something is, the better, because otherwise, I tend to get overwhelmed.

...... 

‚û°Ô∏è NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

üî∫Ô∏è PALETTE: Natasha Denona - Love Palette‚úå 

...... 

üî∫Ô∏è ACQUIRED: purchased myself 

...... 

üëÅ LOOK CREATED: '1/3 Cut-Crease' 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: each pan holds 1.28g of product, rectangular-shaped pans, luxurious plastic casing packaging, bi-fold, palette name &amp; brand is on cover, luxe-weight, magnetic closure system, medium rectangle shape, large mirror inside, tried a heavy magnet &amp; pans ARE removable and able to be shuffled, shade nomenclature is designated southward of each shade 


üîä NOTICE: 

+ At 1.28g, each shadow weighs ABOVE the average amount per pan. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Italy 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è TOTAL # OF SHADES: 15 (all eyeshadows, which are deemed safe by the FDA for use around the eye area). Upon further evaluation, none of these pigments stained my skin. 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è TYPES OF FORMULAS: 3 formulas (8 mattes, 4 shimmers, 3 metallics) 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è DESIGNATION: red/pink toned 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: moderate; recommend doing eyes before base with this palette.

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


‚Ä¢ Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'meh'. Additionally - this palette has a higher cost-per-gram, as compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed. 

......


üîé REVIEW: 


üî∏Ô∏èPATCHINESS: experienced patchiness while using the deep matte purple shade 'Trust' 


üî∏Ô∏èCREASING: no visible creasing after 6-hours of wear


üî∏Ô∏èBLENDABILITY: very easy to blend-out 


üî∏Ô∏èKICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ some shades had kick-back while others didn't 


+ experienced very little fall-out, the most being from shimmer shade 'Lifetime' 


üî∏Ô∏èCOLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There are a few options available to create depth in your look, which drastically improves a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 


+ I don't think any of the shades are repetitive - each one is different and serves a purpose 


+ there are no traditional neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 8:7 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 53% / 47% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. I prefer either fairly balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy spreads. 


+ I classify this as a red/pink toned palette, &amp; I don't find it particularly unique. I own several crossover shades in my collection. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ throughout exploring this entire palette, I DID encounter a 'dud' shade. The shade 'Dream' is technically part of the metallics, but it is awful. It is not on par with any of the other metallic shades. It lacks movement (as well as any shine) in the formula. It's also very difficult to maneuver and work with. 


+ there is no decorative embossing on any of the included shades 

...... 

üî∏Ô∏èFORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

+ | MATTES |: 

‚Ä¢ some of the mattes are a 'cream-to-powder based' matte formula 

‚Ä¢ I didn't have any trouble with the mattes at all 

‚Ä¢ the formula is quite soft and thin 

‚Ä¢ they work well in creating a gradient 

‚Ä¢ I found it very easy to layer them 

‚Ä¢ each shade applied darker than the tone/color that they appear as in their pan. 

‚Ä¢ the matte color selections work well together, it's easy to formulate a look 

‚Ä¢ this is a more 'directly pigmented' formula (in lieu of being 'buildable'), making it more difficult to manage and control the formula 

// 

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

‚Ä¢ these shimmers are all very chunky in texture, and quite thick 

‚Ä¢ there are two duochrome shimmers included 

‚Ä¢ each one of the shimmers is highly reflective 

‚Ä¢ each shimmer has an intense base pigment, allowing them to be multifunctional 

‚Ä¢ these do not require a lot of building; one layer suffices 

‚Ä¢ works perfectly well with your finger, a dry brush, or even with a dampened brush. I didn't notice any significant differences between application type 

// 

+ | METALLICS |: 

‚Ä¢ each one is very smooth and thin 

‚Ä¢ there is no glitter in this formula 

‚Ä¢ has an intense base pigment, so they are not sheer shades 

‚Ä¢ very high-shine 

‚Ä¢ works perfectly well with your finger, a dry brush, or even with a dampened brush. I didn't notice any significant differences between application type 

...... 

üî∏Ô∏èPACKAGING: 


+ I love the packaging design of this palette! Plastic casings are my favorite, as the look great, plus you get the added security of better shadow protection. 


+ I do think this packaging design is a great representation of the brand (Natasha Denona), as it's completely inline with similar products offered in the range. 

...... 

üî∏Ô∏èCOMMENTARY: I know it's a little out-of-season, but I actually just got this palette so I was really excited to use it! I think today's eye look is fun, and definitely a great representation of this palette's versatility. I am on a mission to collect all the ND midi-sized palettes, and this is my first. In my experience, the Natasha Denona formula has really been hit-or-miss, but this palette was a score! I am truly very happy with it. I'm not going to rate it an absolute 'A', because I did have some patchiness, plus that dud shade. 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏èFINAL RECOMMENDATION: (recommend) 

+ extremely easy to blend
+ all the colors work well together
+ exposure to luxury formulas at a lower cost 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Soul 

- Least Favorite Shade: Dream 

...... 

üö¶ RATING: B 

...... 

‚≠ê RATING LEGEND: 

A = totally wow'd me 

B = not the best, but I like it 

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product 

D = this didn't work out for me 

F = I totally hate this

I have recessed tear troughs, which cause more shadow than 

I have tried about 15 concealers (seriously) and all of them start to either separate as i put them on, or after.

It also enhances some lines-but-not-quite-wrinkles

I have watched multiple vids &amp; tried different hacks.

Moisturizer then eyeshadow primer then stippling or patting concealer.

No eyeshadow primer and the above (just ""straight-up application"")

Putting setting spray on my brush.

Tapping setting spray with a beauty blender or fingers.

Setting powder (disaster).

Thin layers.
Using brush or finger.

Sometimes I can pat over it with a tad of primer and re-emulsify it.

**What i have resorsted to** is using eyeshadow primer and then using a skin colored eyeshadow.

It looks the best, but i dont get the coverage I need.

I have used liquid and cream concealers.

I dont know what i am doing wrong.

I'm wondering if it is eye cream, but i have used a few different brands..

I use about a lentil between both eyes.

I need something to depuff my bags (my current has caffine, Matryxl 3000, Eyliss, Haloxyl &amp; Tranexamic Acid.

Is there a serum or two i can use instead of a cream during the day?

Is there a concealer that is an eye-cream &amp; depuffs?

Next week, I‚Äôm going to sleep over at his place for the very first time. I do wear a lot of makeup, and I have never had a boyfriend before- which results in the fact that a man has never seen me without makeup before.

This makes me feel very insecure. I‚Äôm quite afraid that he will not think I‚Äôm beautiful when I‚Äôm not wearing any makeup. On top of that, I shaved off the tails of my eyebrows (to draw on my eyebrows more easily)- and am afraid I will look silly in front of him!

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of the brown and taupe kinda colours in the palettes I own run a bit warm on me, which usually isn‚Äôt a problem but I‚Äôve been dying to do a more classic eyeshadow look with a grey-brown tone in the crease. 

I‚Äôve seen a few palettes that look cool toned but I couldn‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôd swatch warmer without buying them, and then others look too cool as they‚Äôre just grey. I hope I‚Äôm making sense in what kind of shades I‚Äôm looking for? Cool taupes but not outright grey or silver eyeshadow, but also not the same usual warm brown transition tones. 

If anyone can suggest any palettes that are properly cool toned and also reasonably priced (and available in the UK!) I‚Äôd be very grateful. Thanks."

I hope everyone is having a lovely day. I was wondering if there were any tricks on how to keep your makeup look ‚Äúfresh‚Äù and how to keep it for smudging!

851,Makeup,Where does the veins theory coming from?,"I watched a YouTube video where a color analyst discussed the most common myths relating to color analysis &amp; one of the things she touched upon was the veins on our wrists are not a sole indicator in determining the undertone of the skin. She went on to explain that although she has blue veins, her overall undertone is warm.

Back then, I was a believer in the veins theory &amp; thought that blue veins=cool, green=warm but as I learn more, I know that not everyone is a cookie cutter. Sure, there are some people that had undertones matched to their veins but like I said earlier, not everyone matches with this &amp; that. Me for example, I have blue veins but there‚Äôs no indicator of coolness in my undertone.

What are your thoughts? Are veins a sole indicator or not? Does your undertone not exactly matched to your veins?"

863,Makeup,Makeup wearing off through the day‚Ä¶. HELP PLEASE üò©,"
Hey everyone! So I am having some issues with my makeup recently:
- makeup coverage is wearing off half way through the day sometimes only a few hours after. 
- makeup looks cakey and powdered. And it feels dry on my face and heavy.
- makeup seems to slide and transfer onto everything.. 
- creasing in smile line, forehead lines

I‚Äôve always been scared to try new products because if I don‚Äôt like it I hate returning things but I‚Äôm to a point wear I hate how I look with makeup anymore.. so I‚Äôm willing to try new things.. it looks good in photos but in person it‚Äôs awful. 

Here‚Äôs what I use:

‚Ä¢ Skin care/prep: CeraVe Hydrating facial cleanser for normal to dry skin. CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion for normal to dry skin. And CeraVe eye repair cream.

‚Ä¢ Primer: I currently use is ELF mineral infused face primer. I‚Äôve tried ELF putty primer, Milani rose primer, Milani skin quench primer and I‚Äôve tried a few other elf primers. 

‚Ä¢ Foundation: i currently use Covergirl outlast extreme wear 24hr it‚Äôs the one I like the most so far but still have all the problems I‚Äôve mentioned above. I‚Äôve also used Maybelline fit me, L‚ÄôOr√©al infallible, Maybelline Super stay 30hr and recently I bought a foundation from the brand ‚ÄúThe Ordinary‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve even tried Urban decay all nighter before and hated it‚Ä¶ I use a damp real technique sponge to apply. I use usually just a pump sometimes a pump and a half if I have a lot of breakouts and discoloration. 

‚Ä¢ Concealer: I go back and forth between Maybelline fit me and Maybelline instant age rewind. Both wear off or crease and I can see my dark circles. After I use it I take a sponge and pat some loose setting elf HD powder to set it. And then take a fluffy brush and take the excess powder and put all over my face. 

‚Ä¢ Contour: powder benefit hoola bronzer 

‚Ä¢ Blush: Milani rose powder

‚Ä¢ Highlight: Elf powder highlight

I do not use any setting spray because I‚Äôve never had luck with them. I breakout. I do eye makeup and brows but I‚Äôm not having as much of an issue it‚Äôs mostly the face.. I use full coverage foundations because I have alot of discoloration and I get breakouts still at 24‚Ä¶ at least they aren‚Äôt nearly as bad as they were in high school. But any tips or tricks or any new products please let me know below‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm losing my mind‚Ä¶ makeup use to be a passion of mine and I even wanted to become a mua but now it‚Äôs just frustrating me. üôÅ"

My choices are:
Zoeva Together We Shine Eyeshadow Palette,
Natasha Denona Mini Nude Eyeshadow Palette,
Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance Eyeshadow Palette,
Too Faced Born This Way

I also thought if I should include Urban Decay Naked Heat/Naked 3 in my choices. But, they‚Äôre sold out in my area.

I was thinking if anyone can help with the decision? I really like the color theory of both the Zoeva and ND. Zoeva is on the pink side according to reviews while ND seemed to be a true neutral. So, I was thinking if I should purchase both? According to reviews Too Faced seems to be on the neutral brown side as well but it seems to have the complete color set that I would like to have. As for the Anastasia bec. it‚Äôs a cult classic but I found the color theory too pop-py? Should I wait for Urban Decay to be available? Is it worth it considering the price? 

Hoping for your guidance. Thank you very much."

This is her rate and she will be paid in cash. There is no business to take a cut of what she is charging me.

I'm not sure if I should tip or not in this case?

I'm not opposed to tipping, just want to know what people normally do in these cases. And if I should tip, would it be the standard 25%?

She's going to be doing my makeup for 2 days, back to back. If I tip, do I do it at the end of each day she works, or at the end of the last day?"

Red lips seem to accentuate the redness in my face (a mixture of scarring/ongoing spots) and I just don't know what to do! 

I have tried to find one to suit my skin tone (I'm fairly pale) but I'm not confident I've got to grips with what my undertones are etc! I *think* I suit darker reds better, as I have really dark brown hair and green eyes. I think I prefer these colours over the bright bright reds you can get, which I think look a little cheap (on me personally!) Some reds I currently own are  KVD naz fur ahtoo and Vampira. 

If anyone could give any tips or ideas I would really appreciate it - open to any colour suggestions!

873,Makeup,"Contour looks patchy, please help!!","I'd say I have some experience with makeup, but no matter what I do I can't get my contour to look right, whether I use a cream or powder product. The colour comes out extremely uneven, like it's balling up on parts of my skin and simply not going on other parts, and it looks like really exaggerated post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, or dirt on my face. I know not to use a bronzer as contour and to stay away from orangey shades (which make me look even worse, since I'm neutral light olive toned), so it's not the shade. I've used 3CE's contour powder in the cooler shade, and Fenty Beauty's cream contour stick in Amber; the shade match for both of these are fine (not too dark or light), it's just that I can't get the pigmentation to look even. I've tried applying with a brush, fingers, sponge.... nothing helps. The patchiness gets worse as I blend the product out. Powdering my skin before contouring has no effect. I don't usually use primer (since I hate the feeling of too many products on my skin) and I don't think this is a dry skin issue, as I  have moderately oily skin, and I regularly exfoliate and moisturise twice a day. My skin isn't perfect and there is a little bit of texture here and there on the sides of my cheeks, but it's not that pronounced, so I don't think it's my skin's texture interfering with the product either, as people with more textured skin than me can seem to make contouring products work for them. The driest areas of my face are around the eyes and on my chin, and I occasionally get flaking on my chin and nose, but my cheeks generally don't have this problem. Despite that, I have a lot of trouble getting contour and cream blushes to stick. I do have post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from previous spots; contouring products seem to emphasise them, if that makes sense? 

Please help!! I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I can't find anything online that addresses my issue, and similar threads generally conclude that the issue is dry skin, which doesn't seem to be the case for me.

If it helps, the foundation I use is Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Foundation, though sometimes I use Dior's cushion foundation. Also, I still have a problem with patchy contour even if I skip the foundation and only wear SPF over my usual skincare."

I am about to run to Ulta to get some things for my eyebrows but first, I need some help choosing products that fit my needs.

For context, I had a bad eyebrow waxing incident that took off the inner portion of my eyebrows so that they sit further apart than normal. The hair never grew back and I have been working on creating the perfect brow with makeup ever since. 

I add length in the middle using powder &amp; pencil. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of gels or waxes but open to ideas there too. 

Here‚Äôs where i need your help: 

I do a good bit of smudging when i add length to create a gentle, faded gradient edge. I often wish I had a product to clean up the smudging under and below the brow to make it more defined. I‚Äôve used concealer in the past but it i find it always gets cakey or looks super visible even if I try to blend it out. It almost seems too thick or the wrong color? 

Can anyone recommend a product to use, when cleaning up and shaping around the edges, that gives some umph (or highlight?) but looks a bit more natural and less cakey? Additionally, do those pink pencils work that I‚Äôve seen people use to outline for a bit of a bright effect?

i watched a bunch of youtube tutorials like a newbie thinking there must be something im doing wrong and tried a bunch of different techniques (dusting a tiny amount on w a brush, using a damp sponge, powder puff, moisturizing more than usual, ETC) and trying different powders (maybelline fit me, kosas cloud, lys, tarte glow..) nothing was impressive at all. I figured why not go back to my roots and try the LM again with a sober non influencer influenced mind and more experience with makeup and powders. damn guys, the LM translucent really is good.. i have combo skin, this stuff really doesnt make my undereyes look dry yet it controls oil pretty well and just really sits nice on the face. im so confused at how the other powders looked dry under my eyes and sometimes cakey around my nose but this one looks good under eyes but manages oil as well? i dont know if i just have finicky under eyes but it just works on me. if anyone has any suggestions id be super open to hearing them!"

I am tired of my foundation (nars natural radiant longwear) ending up on my deeper toned partner‚Äôs face (and it‚Äôs happened to multiple so can‚Äôt be boiled down to an individual‚Äôs specific skin type). I have tried urban decay (original) all nighter setting spray, morphe continuous setting mist, and the too faced 3 in 1. Im inclined to not immediately point the finger at my foundation itself because i dont have an issue with transfer onto clothes or other things (aside from masks but i dont think thats avoidable). 

Anyways it‚Äôs embarrassing and i don‚Äôt want to have to think about that when I‚Äôm smoochin someone.

If it helps my makeup routine after skincare is the tiktok one (LOL):
1. Skincare that ends with fenty moisturizer w/ spf that i let soak in a little bit.
2. Super light light barely there dusting of too faced translucent setting powder
3. Followed by a whole face application of setting spray (not heavy just mist the whole face with morphe continuous setting mist).
4. You wait till that dries/soaks in and then you apply primer, i was using maybelline master primer w/ spf but recently started using the ‚ÄúUD all nighter ultra glow face primer dewy foundation grip‚Äù (what a long name). Both are great.
5. Then top with concealer if applicable and/or foundation. 

This has always been an issue (before my tiktok routine, before product changes, etc.), so i think it could be resolved potentially by a better setting/finishing spray or something. But im open to anything. Im genuinely tired of this happening."

I've heard from a friend that concealer works great for scars but there's a problem, I've been to cosmetics shops and all and have people there helped me find the right tone yet the tone is always right for for example my arm and hand, but I can never find the right tone for for example the inside of my lower arm or the bottom of my chin. It's always too dark, too pink, too yellow or too bronze.

I as a girl was always into makeup and stuff but wasn't allowed to use it until recently. (I even got a slap from my father for applying lipstick when I was 12-ish. Lol.) I started using eyeliner only a few months back and honestly I am so in love with wearing eyeliner but again I am not allowed to. (Breaking rules a few times a week isn't that bad). Anyway, I got away from the topic. So I used the eyeshadow pallate and brushes (given by my aunt) throughout the last week for my other aunt's wedding. We had a desi wedding if you wonder why it took a whole week. So used the makeup almost everyday for a week trying out different colors and styles(loved the feeling). 
So my question is how often should I clean my brushes? I cleaned them today. I know we should clean them regularly but don't know how often.

Everything was okay for a few hours, but the itching, burning, and redness has returned.

\- Completone is a brand that focuses on serums(Serumkind) and foundations(Surebase). Their products are 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and contain no paraben.  Completone's Chaga charging drop is made with Siberian Chaga mushroom which helps with supercharging and multi-nourishing. Also, their long lasting foundations were highly recommended by 'Vogue'. I'm personally using Completone's products (Chaga charging drop, Deep antarctic drop, and Glad glow foundation) and really loving it. The dewy finish of the foundation is especially amazing. 

2. [Round A‚ÄôRound](https://global.oliveyoung.com/display/page/brand-page?brandNo=B00121) : Clean beauty

\- From skincare to bathing products, Round A'round has a variety of products. Their 'Green Tea Pure Cleansing Foam' is a go to product if you are looking for a mild and moisturizing cleansing form. It even won Olive Young's 2021 awards. Currently using the sample and planning to purchase one in the future. They have good skin care products as well. So if you like the cleansing form you can also try their toner, serum, and cream. 

3. [Beauty of Joseon](https://beautyofjoseon.com/): Cruelty-free 

\- Beauty of Joseon is famous for 'Low pH Rice Cleansing Bar' and 'Nobang Soap Saver' Kit. Their iconic Organza fabric that is most similar to Korean traditional cloth 'Hanbok' creates a richer and softer foam than other commercially available mesh pouches. Love the traditional design of the product. Planning to order this product once I am done using my current soap."

üîπÔ∏èPURPOSE: ...LET'S TALK MAKEUP! This is just window-shopping the new beauty releases (one of my favorite things to do!) Sometimes, I come across some really awesome, inspiring products - other times, I feel some type of way about a few of these releases.

‚ñ™Ô∏èSydney Grace - March 2022 Bundle 


üí≤ Price: $20.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Indie Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï I truly believe that the Sydney Grace quality is unparalleled. They are one of the few brands that I have come to continually *expect* greatness from, because they've previously delivered so many times. What *really* enticed me about this month's bundle is the unusual blue scheme. Firstly, I am an outright sucker for a blue eyeshadow, then - adding in the fact that they are atypical shades is making them even more captivating. I love how they paired the bold, vibrant blues with very neutral browns - it's just an overall well-done bundle and easy-to-wear. From this set, I can envision creating a complete eye look out of the five provided shades without having to bring in any companion products. I also love the inspiration of 'California' - the carefreeness and freedom that the Cali-life portrays. Lastly, I'm really trying to build and curate my 'singles' collection, and this set would make a profound addition to my growing collection.

‚ñ™Ô∏èDominique Cosmetics - The Moment Eyeshadow Palette 


üí≤ Price: $? 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Influencer-brand Makeup / Indie Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï Again - I'm a complete blue-eyeshadow enthusiast, and this palette *really* speaks to me on a certain level. However, I just can't continue wasting my money on Dominique Cosmetics eyeshadow palettes! I've bought every single one thus far, and not ONE of them has worked in my favor. I find them nearly impossible to blend-out (and I get the worst looks and harshest lines), taking into consideration *every* formula that I own. I love the concept of the brand, and I'm truly charmed by each one of her releases. There just has to be a definitive point as to where I quit wasting my time and efforts on products that I *cannot* get to work. 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏èMelt Cosmetics - Slick Waterline Pencils 


üí≤ Price: $19.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Indie Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï I've been in dire need of a pencil specifically formulated for the waterline, and I just came across this release! Assuming all the claims are true about these pencils, this is *exactly* what I have been looking for. I especially shop Melt Cosmetics for all their unique shades, and I'm definitely intrigued by several of the shades offered. I'm really hoping to grab one (or maybe two!) and see if these live up to the hype. They sound great in theory...but do they actually work? 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏èChanel - Stylo Lumi√®re Regard 


üí≤ Price: $36.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Luxury Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï This is just a giant *no*. I have distinct, trustworthy sources where I seek information regarding certain product launches. Everybody that I absolutely believe in (that reviews luxury makeup products) has despised these highlighter pens. Apparently they are a new style of product for Chanel, something that's never been done before. I saw both shades in action, applied in a multitude of ways - and the performance was awful, and definitely not indicative of a luxury makeup product. 


......


‚ñ™Ô∏èBlack Radiance - True Complexion Tinted Moisturizer 


üí≤ Price: $7.99 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Drugstore Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï It's really been awhile since Black Radiance released a new product, so this is a welcomed rarity! In my experience with the brand, I've always been pleasantly surprised with its workings. Tinted moisturizers are one of the hottest makeup trends, so it doesn't really surprise me that they jumped on the opportunity. A tinted moisturizer-type product was also a void in their product lineup, so this launch makes sense. Considering both my familiarity with the brand *and* the cost of this product, I'm willing to buy it and try it out! 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏èFlower Beauty - Pyramids Cheek Color 


üí≤ Price: $11.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Drugstore Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï The reality is that I never have any success with a product like this, and I end up getting frustrated and frenzied during application. This product is indeed supposed to be a face palette, each area segmented out. However, problems arise as there are no barriers between products. I also don't like that the texture and finish of the *entire* face palette is identical. I can attest to the fact that the actual product looks chic and snazzy - but unless utilized for one-step in the makeup routine, it's just unreasonable. 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏èMakeup Revolution - IRL Filter Longwear Foundation 


üí≤ Price: $14.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Affordable Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï I know many of you may disagree, but I am excited about this one! Makeup Revolution has some excellent complexion products. Every single piece that I've ever tried has been top-notch and reflective of a much higher-end product. The claims and benefits of this foundation seem exactly like one that I would find great joy in wearing. I would really have a lot of fun doing a full-day wear-test on this formula, and finding out how it differs from the other Makeup Revolution foundations! 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏èRimmel London - Kind &amp; Free Clean Mascara 


üí≤ Price: $7.49 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Drugstore Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï Well, I really have nothing against this, honestly. I actually really, really, really like Rimmel London - as they are hardcore one of my favorite drugstore brands! This frankly just looks and sounds really boring to me. It doesn't boast any monumental differences from top-rated formulas, and the packaging itself is awfully subpar. Rimmel is known for offering fantastic quality for a much-lower price, and this mascara's cost doesn't seem to align with their other offerings. It's just not something I'm interested in. 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏èPat McGrath Labs x Bridgerton - SatinAllure Lipstick 


üí≤ Price: $28.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Luxury Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï Oh, excuse me - this is probably awfully haughty - but I simply want one of these for the limited, upgraded, exclusive packaging! How adorable is this lipstick casing component? I have a lipstick display on my vanity where I showcase my most-beautifully packaged lipsticks, and this would be so delightful as an addition! Of course, the colors are incredibly wearable when it comes to my personal 'every day' makeup taste, so I'd get a lot of actual use out of it, too!

1027,Makeup,What is your experience on men preferring makeup or none,"Hi all, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub to ask. So I have lash extensions, used to wear volume and now I‚Äôm doing hybrid. I don‚Äôt wear much makeup (brows and concealer) but the lashes make it look like a full face. 
My experience for the year+ I‚Äôve had them is family and guys telling me it doesn‚Äôt suit me, better off natural. I try to see the man‚Äôs perspective and why. They tell me they prefer a girl with or minimal to none. 
I always thought it was a bullshit answer because guys reply to stories with compliments of me in full face then switch up and say they want natural. 
My full face is tinted moisturizer, concealer, brows, highlight, bit of eyeshadow to pop my eyes. (Which I rarely do) 
Pretty much every guy says I‚Äôm beautiful without makeup. So it makes me overthink and I‚Äôve been debating removing lashes and feeling it out. 
And a huge part of me doesn‚Äôt want to listen to a man‚Äôs opinion but if my family and every guy says it, maybe they‚Äôre right ?

What are your thoughts and experiences ?"
1028,Makeup,Suggestions on how to use ‚ÄòBetter Than Sex‚Äô mascara,"Hi all! I‚Äôm a little new to the group!
I wanted to take your advice on how to make the most out of ‚ÄòBetter Than Sex‚Äô Mascara.

I gave into the hype and bought it but I feel it‚Äôs like any other mascara. I have noticed that a lot of the product gets collected on the wand‚Äôs tip and doesn‚Äôt come on the brush properly. 

Usually after putting mascara, I curl my lashes, followed by another round of mascara.

1032,Makeup,Are there any good recommendations for a bright rainbow/pastel eyeshadow palette that contains non toxic or organic ingredients?,"Hi, so long story short I wanna cosplay and being new to makeup I‚Äôve been looking for non toxic products because I‚Äôm scared of products that cause rash or irritation.

I was originally considering the James Charles Palette (disregarding that he got canceled so I don‚Äôt support him anymore, I love the colors in that palette) but after doing some research on it the palette contains extremely toxic ingredients that I would like to avoid.

I specifically need bright palette colors so that it shows up on cosplay makeup and is more diverse for multiple cosplays- essentially I‚Äôm not going to wear it out on a daily basis for regular use.

Does anyone have any good recommendations on a good colorful eyeshadow palette with diverse colors that contains completely non toxic ingredients? If there are none that exist because realistically bright colors likely do contain toxic ingredients, is there any good recommendations that contains little toxic ingredients or ingredients that will not cause rashes inflammation or rashes? 

Also I‚Äôm new to makeup so should I just bypass this whole problem and get the James Charles pallet? Are the health concerns a huge deal? What are the side effects of constantly wearing makeup that isn‚Äôt non toxic?

Sorry I‚Äôm asking so many questions, I just worry about my skin and my health as I already struggle with acne and oily skin and irritation

I‚Äôd really like to try out different things but I‚Äôve honestly no idea where to start. Currently I use foundation by Illamasqua as it was recommended to me by a MUA, however by the end of the day it looks cakey and well, just a bit crap. 

I have really pale skin and thanks to an autoimmune disease that causes flare ups, there tends to be a constant redness on my face too! 

My skin is often dry so I tend to moisturise quite heavily before applying to try and get as much time without it looking / feeling dry.  

I‚Äôm UK based, if anyone has any recommendations for foundations (or even primer? To be honest I don‚Äôt know where to start with that either!) I‚Äôd be forever grateful! Trying to feel a little more girly and confident!

Thanks guys"

(For reference I have combo/oily skin)"
1051,Makeup,Why doesn‚Äôt my makeup last all day?,"I‚Äôm using good brands like two face foundation, hoola matte bronzer by benefit, tarte or it cosmetics concealer, with a translucent powder and photo finish primer but I still find that my make up doesn‚Äôt last all day and comes off to where you can see my acne or bare skin after a few hours wear. I don‚Äôt want to cake on my makeup, but idk how else to make it last throughout the day and look flawless! Suggestions?"
1052,Makeup,Any such thing as an eyelash tinter?,"hi everyone, I don‚Äôt use much makeup but I am going to get back into using makeup as I‚Äôm growing my eyelashes back. I‚Äôve had trichotillomania for most of my life (addiction to pulling out hair) so I‚Äôm usually completely eyelash-less. this look is not appealing to me so I‚Äôm growing them back.

the last time I grew them back I used mascara to darken them, but mascara coats eyelashes and leaves them hardened almost. this texture provokes me to touch my eyelashes excessively which makes me relapse eventually. so I‚Äôm wondering if there are mascaras that do not leave this coat and just tint them a darker color temporarily."
1053,Makeup,Foundation tips," 

Hi, there! I am getting married next month and I am 46. My skin has always been easy to deal with, normal, never really broke out and I haven't really looked my age until the last 4-5 years or so. My dermatologist says I still look to be in my 30s but I am not sure I believe it. LOL

Anyways the point of my post is that as I have aged I am developing some of the ""orange peel texture""look on my upper cheeks below my ""under eye area"". The derm explained getting older, losing plumpness, peptides can help, etc etc. I ordered The Ordinary ""Buffet"" to try it out as it has good reviews for peptides.

My main question is over the last few years I am having a terrible time with foundations. I had never had an issue before.

Using a brush or a sponge, my makeup doesn't look smooth anymore when I put it on. It sometimes looks smeary or smudgy. I use No 7 Lift and Luminate nightly cream and I stopped using the day cream version, because I thought it might be causing the trouble since it is so thick and often is still tacky even when dry. However, I have found even with a cetaphil lightweight moisturizer I am having this issue.

Right now the only thing I can get to look okay is the Cetaphil tinted moisturizer cream (applied with sponge) and powder to set it, then a light brush of bronzer to even out my color. It works okay, but I am not in love with it- especially for my wedding!

I would like to wear a more covering foundation again and I want my face to have a non-smudgy or  
non-smeared looking finish.

I understand that the look of airbrushing doesn't look flawless up close, but does it look good from a few feet away? LOL I really want to try the Sephora airbrush foundation spray. If that doesn't work out for me, what other foundations do you suggest? I have a ton of different primers, too- my last favorite was the NYX Marshmallow. However, they haven't seemed to make a difference with my foundation issues, so I am wondering I am just not starting with a good base to begin with.

I wash my face every morning with cool water to wipe off any moisturizer from the night before. I am not greasy so don't feel like I need to use a face wash.

I have blonde hair and very fair skin, however I do color nicely if I choose to tan (which I avoid) and I have blue eyes. I seem to be a more neutral undertone as opposed to a pink or a yellow. I have people suggest trying Estee Lauder foundation today, so I will also look into that.

Sorry if I am all over the place! I am normally not so disorganized with my posts- I think wedding stress has fried my brain! LOL

1057,Makeup,i need a specific shade of lipliner and i CANNOT find it anywhere,"so, i had this lipliner i used for a long time, it‚Äôs like a mauve- taupe- pink kind of color. it was from one of those sketchy brands that you can‚Äôt find any trace of online. now, it fell out of my bag somehow and i‚Äôve been trying to find a replacement. but my problem is that nothing, and i mean nothing, has come close to that color. the description will literally say ‚Äúmauve‚Äù and then it‚Äôs straight up barbie pink. the closest i‚Äôve found is nyx lip liner ‚Äúpale pink‚Äù but it‚Äôs just a tad too light for me and looks like i‚Äôve got nothing on. i‚Äôve wasted abt $40 dollars now. does anyone have a good recommendation for this lip liner? i‚Äôve attached a swatch from google of pale pink for reference :)

 [swatch of ‚Äúpale pink‚Äù is on top left](https://images.app.goo.gl/B16ikFKKpizymM16A)"
1058,Makeup,"What is a good brand of foundation for dry, sensitive skin?","I have been thinking about changing my foundation for a while now. I just ran out of my Wet N Wild dewy foundation (in shell ivory) and was thinking about changing it up. Lately Wet N Wild has been breaking me out every time I use it. I‚Äôve always used drugstore, but now I‚Äôm thinking about trying a good brand (as long as it is under $50).

Here is some information about me: 
I have dry, extremely sensitive skin.
I prefer the makeup to be cruelty free. 
I don‚Äôt really care if it is full coverage, I just want something that will cover my acne scars that I received from skin care I had a extreme breakout from. 

Any ideas on what brands I should be eyeing? I‚Äôve been thinking about Este Lauder (not cruelty free though), Fenty, or Rare Beauty, but want some other brands of good foundation."
1059,Makeup,Looking for a different foundation to use. One that is full coverage and won‚Äôt dry my skin out or oxidize. I currently use doublewear by Est√©e Lauder. It is drying my skin out so badly and settling in my fine lines . Any recommendations please ?!,[removed]
1060,Makeup,We just got off masks here and I need your subtle and dramatic af lipstick shades that make you feel like the bad b*tch you are,My dad moved all my lipsticks and now I can‚Äôt find them so I need suggestions on what to buy so I look like a goddess
1061,Makeup,Is the Dior lip glow oil discontinued?,I recently saw that the Dior lip glow oil was removed from the Dior website and is sold out everywhere. Is it being discontinued? Or reformulated?
1062,Makeup,Cream / Gel Contour Recommendations?,"I'm looking for recommendations for good budget cream or gel contour products that I can wear without foundation.  I'm relatively new to makeup but have learned that I prefer products that I can apply with my fingers or else like a pen (brushes and I are not friends).  I got a gel highlighter that works well with my skin texture, so I'm looking for something similarly textured to learn to contour with - nothing majorly transformative just a little accentuating what's already there.  My skin tone is Buff in ELF flawless foundation, although some days I'm paler / more translucent than others, and I tan pretty easily in the summer.  TYIA!"
1063,Makeup,Too faced born this way concealer,"Why is everyone raving on about this concealer? Everyone claimed it was the ‚Äúthe holy grail‚Äù of concealers but when I used it, it dries up instantly, flakes off and doesn‚Äôt blend easily. It‚Äôs a great full coverage concealer thought. 
Anyone know how to prevent this?üíï"
1064,Makeup,Kylie LipKits,"I love Kylie, but her lip-kits aren‚Äôt the best. At least not in Australia. I bought the Kylie lip kit in shade ‚ÄòKylie‚Äô it‚Äôs my fav lip shade ever and it is very pigmented. But it‚Äôs so mattifying that it dries up my lips and chaps them. And it flakes off the within 30 minutes. Thoughts? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1065,Makeup,"nail polish color for that ""clean"" and ""basic"" look",i usually go for nude tones and prefer them long but i was wondering if even the length matters when it comes to wanting to look as clean as possible? thanks
1066,Makeup,Newbie To False Lashes,"Hi everyone, I am considering adding false lashes to my makeup routine. A couple things to note:

1. I WFH and wear make up tops 3x a week, more on vaca which is only a couple times a year. 

2. The skin under my eyes is extremely sensitive and taking mascara off has caused terrible reactions and visits to the derm - I‚Äôd like to avoid the awful pain of removing mascara and go with lashes in the hopes of saving my skin.

3. I‚Äôve never applied flash lashes on myself, only other time I had them was on my wedding day and I believe glue was used. I‚Äôm a little apprehensive to go the glue route in case of a reaction.

I‚Äôve seen magnetic lashes, are they heavy? Any tips or recommendations of brands or styles for absolute amateurs for lashes?

Thank you!"

üò≤ Essential Makeup Accessories üèÖ

......

‚û°Ô∏è NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

üîπÔ∏èPURPOSE: the purpose of this post is to highlight eight specific tools, that through my experience, I have found vital for using alongside makeup products. 

......

#1 - MINI SPRAY BOTTLES 


üí≤ Price Estimate: $1 


‚ñ™Ô∏èWHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: these are great to keep around! I currently have two of them - one filled with water, and one filled with isopropyl alcohol. I use the water-filled one frequently during makeup application to dampen metallic shades on my brush to help them apply more 'foiled'. I use the alcohol-filled one to keep my powder products disinfected and clean. These little bottles are small, making them very easy to store. They also have a good spraying mechanism, so if you wanted to apply anything directly to your face (perhaps you need to transfer a setting spray from a faulty bottle), they would perform just fine.¬† 

......

#2 - MICROFIBER TOWELS 


üí≤ Price Estimate: $1 


‚ñ™Ô∏èWHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: having these as part of your makeup routine is beyond critical. I use one of these every single day, and they are a game-changer. You can use these to dry-clean your makeup brushes after you are finished using them, or between shades by simply wiping the brush and swirling it onto the fabric. The microfiber material completely cleans the bristles of any eyeshadow residue (by its clinging powers), making your brushes spotless again. These work in the same way as something like a 'color switch' does, but you get far more material for a far less price. I have a ton of these! The best thing is that when you completely fill-up your in-use towel, you simply throw it in the wash for next time!¬† 

......

#3 - PARTITIONED PALETTE 


üí≤ Price Estimate: $1 


‚ñ™Ô∏èWHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: I tend to mix a lot of things together during makeup application, so something like this really comes in handy. You can literally use any flat surface you prefer as a mixing palette, but I really like a partitioned palette. It serves to contain your product as well as provide you several sections for use. Each section has enough space large enough to fit a brush, and subsequently pickup the product. For my personal mixing palette, I use a top to an old Rubbermaid salad container. It has served me well over the years! When you are finished using it, it simply wipes clean. For a more deep-cleanse, you can handwash it with a little dish soap, and let it air-dry. 

......

#4 - INSTANT BRUSH CLEANSER 


üí≤ Price Estimate: $10 - $30 


‚ñ™Ô∏èWHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: this is a HARDCORE necessity. There are so many brands with several options available, but I can't speak for any besides the Art√≠s foaming cleanser. Cream products are really on trend right now, and as lovely as they are - they sure can mess up some brushes. If you leave those brushes to sit out and you don't immediately care for them, the brush's bristles get really gunked up, dried out, and are basically unusable. I use an instant brush cleanser every single time I use a brush with a liquid/cream product. I simply put a little foam on a microfiber towel, and then swirl my brush in the foam and cleanse it on the towel. It completely removes all the products, and makes the brush look brand new. An instant cleanser doesn't take long to dry, so the brushes are almost instantaneously reusable. They don't need that extra time to set-out and dry overnight. An instant brush cleanser is also a valuable product to have if you are a person that doesn't often get around to deep-cleaning your entire brush collection on a routine schedule. This could extend the time between washings, and will keep your brushes shipshape. 

......

#5 - COTTON SWABS 


üí≤ Price Estimate: $1 


‚ñ™Ô∏èWHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: this is kind of a boring one, but one I use so frequently that I just HAD to mention it. Cotton swabs are extremely multipurpose. My favorite 'makeup' way to utilize them is to simply swipe a clean swab along my waterline prior to applying an eyeliner. It removes any moisture on the waterline and allows for the ultimate application - supremely pigmented and ultra-smooth. You can also use cotton swabs to masterfully clean-up any small makeup mishaps, or even use them as a fun, unique eyeshadow applicator. A pack of these doesn't cost a ton, and they are great to have around your beauty space. 

......

#6 - LARGE COATED MAGNET 


üí≤ Price Estimate: $5 


‚ñ™Ô∏èWHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: it took me awhile to find a 'good' one, but I've finally found it. I really like customizing my eyeshadow palettes (those that have removable pans) and creating color-stories that are more appealing to me. Although magnetic, attempting to pry them out with a non-magnetic flat tool can cause immense damage to both the shadow and the pan. The best way to go is by using a strong, effective magnet that isn't going to affect the condition of the eyeshadow or its componentry. The strength of the magnet is important, as you want to ensure you get one large enough to remove eyeshadow pans, but not overly strong where it harms the shadows. I use this a LOT, and it's really served me well so far!

......

#7 - SALINE SOLUTION 


üí≤ Price Estimate: $3 


‚ñ™Ô∏èWHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: this is one of those things that's just always advantageous to keep on hand. It's not necessarily something that needs to be permanently stored IN your makeup collection, however - I find myself reaching for it quite often. If you are a person that enjoys getting the most 'mileage' out of your makeup products, using a saline solution will help you achieve that. If you are experiencing a product that has sort of dried-out or dehydrated over time, yet it's still within expiration terms - a little added saline solution will assist in reviving the formula. I add this to many of my liquid eyeshadows, liquid glitter liners, and sometimes brow pomades to improve the functionality. It's a cheap way to renew a product without having to wastefully toss it, just to buy another.

......

#8 - LASH SEPARATOR 


üí≤ Price Estimate: $2 


‚ñ™Ô∏èWHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: I bought this years ago, and it's still going strong! This is something that I use each and every time that I work on my eyelashes. No matter the mascara, I have an issue where the outer portion of my lashes clump and stick together. This tool is a lash savior! If you experience any lash sticking or clumping, this easily and swiftly combs the lashes into a uniform position. This is especially great if you are dealing with a mascara that is giving you trouble - it truly separates each individual lash.

‚ñ™Ô∏è DESIGNATION: mix-toned (neutral &amp; bold)

‚Ä¢ Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'excellent'. Additionally, this palette has a VERY affordable cost-per-gram compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed.

......

üîé REVIEW: 


üî∏Ô∏èPATCHINESS: no patchiness 


üî∏Ô∏èBLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out 


üî∏Ô∏èKICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ experienced kick-back in all shades used 


+ experienced fall-out, the most being from matte shade 'Yacht Life' 


üî∏Ô∏èCOLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There are quite a few options available to create depth in your look, which drastically improves a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 


+ there are many neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 19:16 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 54% / 46% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. 


+ I classify this as a mix-toned (neutral and bold) palette, &amp; I don't have another palette like this in my collection. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ throughout exploring this entire palette, I didn't encounter any 'dud' shades. 


üî∏Ô∏èFORMULA EVALUATION: 

//

+ | MATTES |: 

‚Ä¢ each one is soft, and maintains the same consistency across the palette

‚Ä¢ they are perfect for creating gradients 

‚Ä¢ layering them is almost impossible 

‚Ä¢ they are absolutely true-to-tone

‚Ä¢ it was difficult to build them up to reach their maximum potential 

‚Ä¢ this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula

//

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

‚Ä¢ these shimmers are very hard-pressed

‚Ä¢ each one has a base pigment, making them multifunctional 

‚Ä¢ these shimmers require building for great outcome

‚Ä¢ works perfectly well with a dry brush, works even better with a dampened brush

......

üî∏Ô∏èPACKAGING: 


+ The exterior cover design/art matches the interior color-story quite well, and is on-theme with the palette's name. 


+ I think this packaging is a great representation of the brand (Morphe), as it's inline with several other products in this range.

......

üî∏Ô∏èRECOMMENDATION: I know this eye look is kind of weird, but I really wanted to create something that would capture the entire essence of this palette. I wanted to combine the blues, pinks, and neutrals in some way. I'm not entirely crazed about Morphe palettes, but some of them are actually really intriguing. I preferred the color selection in here, and I appreciate all the similar tones, making it very easy to create gradients. There's a hell-of-a-lot of looks to be done with this palette, and when I look at it - I just get fully inspired! 

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èFINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend)

+ very easy to work with

+ amount of blend-out shades

+ multiple angles of depth

......

+ Favorite Shade: Windsurf

- Least Favorite Shade: Lazy Days

......

üö¶ RATING: A

......

‚≠ê RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

......

1095,Makeup,How do I level up my makeup?,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm somewhat of a beginner to makeup and have been experimenting with new products and styles. Currently my go-to routine is to use some The Ordinary Moisturiser on my chin, neck, and undereyes, Morphe foundation on top of these areas (these are the darkest areas on my face, or the places which have blemishes). I then use a Morphe Eyeliner Colour Pencil (I think in the shade Trendsetter) to do some eyelinger on the outer end of my bottom lid, continue it outwards to do a wing, and then connect it with my top lid and fill it in. I'll then go futher inwards on my top lid to get the eyeliner just above my eye, not just at the ends of my eye. Then I go in with mascara on the top and bottom lashes. I'll then put lip balm on my lips, and some sort of liquid lip or lipstick over the top. (Sorry for the terrible description, this is the first time I've ever described what I do:/). Sometimes I'll do blush or eyeshadow as well (super basic, just something shimmery or very light coloured eyeshadow) if I have time. 

It kind of looks like this at the moment (random video found on the internet, time 3:13): [https://youtu.be/CC-Domq\_Asw?t=193](https://youtu.be/CC-Domq_Asw?t=193)

I'm trying to figure out how to get my makeup to look like this: [https://i.redd.it/scy7vxn5zpp81.jpg](https://i.redd.it/scy7vxn5zpp81.jpg)

It's super glam and sharp and sooo beautiful. How would I get it to this level? Is anyone experienced in this level of makeup able to tell me how long it would take to do this amount of makeup before going out? Should I be putting foundation over my entire face (I don't at the moment because my face is dry and it gets cracked/textured - which is why I use moisturiser under my foundation at the moment - so should I find a good primer too, and if so, any recommendations?)? Should I be using false eyelashes, and if so, wouldn't that damage my eyelashes? Would a lip plumper damage my lips? Anything else I should add to my routine?

Thank you so much for all the advice in advance!"
1096,Makeup,"Help please: No matter what I do, my skin always looks flat matte when I‚Äôm trying to achieve a dewy/glowy look.","I work in cosmetics so I have to wear a full face every day.

Do I just not put concealer there and live with the redness? Is there something else I should be doing? I try not to scrub my skin unless I have to, because it *all* dries out and looks like that. Also scrubbing those areas makes them raw and they really sting.

I *hate* the feathered look and the arched look, which is why I started drawing them. I also like having really dark pronounced eyebrows, so whatever I use has to be bold.

In either late Fall 2019 or maybe January 2020 I was on a work trip to Nashville. I realized I forgot to pack my beauty blender so went to Target and grabbed one for under $10. It was turquoise. Rounded bottom. Hourglass shape. The top had a flat side. I loved it more than my beauty blender and I used it until it fell apart.

It was similar to this turquoise one: [https://www.amazon.com/l-f-Blending-Sponge-Latex-Free-85097/dp/B079HTFZR7](https://www.amazon.com/l-f-Blending-Sponge-Latex-Free-85097/dp/B079HTFZR7) in terms of the rounded bottom, hourglass shape, and colour, but this one is missing the flat edge.  
This one has the flat top but is missing the rounded bottom: [https://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-highlighting-blending-sponge/-/A-52504348#lnk=sametab](https://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-highlighting-blending-sponge/-/A-52504348#lnk=sametab) 

I've been through every sponge Target sells online and can't find a match. So far, e.l.f. is the closest match but I'm thinking maybe it was in a shape they no longer make BUT DOES ANYONE KNOW? Anyone remember what beauty sponges target was selling 2+ years ago? That's a normal thing for someone to keep track of, right? Is this the dumbest thing I've ever tried to crowdsource?

My SIL has been living with us for a while after a bad divorce and is really kicking ass and getting her life better than it was. She is very big into doing her make-up and hair.  She keeps mentioning she wants a good area to get ready and just generally decompress. 
I talked to my wife (who doesn't wear make-up, so is as unsure as I am). And I said I wanted to build her a nice area for it in her room. 

So far my plan is:
My space is about 5 feet long

Obviously tons of light. 

Plugs hidden some where accessible

 a wireless charger built into the top.

Something that won't stain easily and
 cleans well 

She mentioned a chair that, to me,  looks like a director's chair, but the only reason is that it has a back, so alternative chairs with backs?

And things like I plan on it being basically 2 small ""cabinets"" with a top that can be removed, so if she ever decides to move, or we all move as a family again,  we can get this huge thing out.   


ANYHOW back to my question. What things would really make an excellent space for you all? Drawers vs cabinets? Big and deep for like blow driers and stuff? Small skinny ones? How many plugs is enough? 

I'd love if you could link pictures then point out specifics of possible. Like I said, I'm just a dumb truck driverü§£

Anyhow thank you so so much

I have really long, straight, and light blonde eyelashes that naturally tangle ( maybe because they are soft?) For years I have struggled to find ways to keep them curled all day. I have tried everything. I obviously have an eyelash curler (the tart one). I heat it a little before use, I do the curl up the lash trick. I spend forever curling them bc they take forever to curl in a way that looks nice (they are stubborn!) 

Then I use waterproof mascara (better than sex). I usually end up having to curl them again after applying mascara bc they already start to fall, but then they start to stick to together and look spidery. Then, after all that, a few hours later they will probably start to fall, or be completely straight again! Even in cold weather, so it‚Äôs not just because of humidity. 

I guess my question is: what now? Is there anything else I can try? Any tips or products I should look into? I don‚Äôt want to rely on extensions or eyelash perm bc of the cost and the maintenance. Thanks everyone!"

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to everyone who responded - it has been a wild ride that‚Äôs for sure. 

I will not buy the lede - the winner is **Giorgio Armani Silk in 5.75**. To quickly recap, I have dry skin and needed a new foundation. However, I have olive skin so it made color matching a bit harder. (I've never worn MAC so idk my color in their system but I am definitely warm and definitely olive)

I kind of treated it like a bracket, and yesterday I swatched the final 2 contenders to declare the winner. Over the course of the week or so, I visited Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Sephora, Target and Ulta.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very up front with every sales person I encountered, and gave more or less this exact spiel - *I am on a recon mission, I will not be buying today but I aim to buy ASAP, I want to sample a foundation at home on top of my sunscreen using my normal morning routine to see how it performs, and I will be purchasing the winner hopefully by the end of the week.* 

Most salespeople were terrible at color matching compared to me trying to find my own match, except 1 woman at Sephora. I don't hold that against them though, cause I see my face multiple times every single day, so it stands to reason I have a better idea of what suits me. Here's everything I tried, in alphabetical order:

&amp;#x200B;

* Armani Power Fabric 6.0 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Armani Silk 6.0 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)* It is incredibly annoying that these 2 Armani shades in 6.0 were so different to each other. Power Fabric was deeper and cooler even though they were both 6.0
* Chanel Les Beiges 30 - too pink, no options warm enough *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Chanel Sublimage 60 - too deep *(matched by a different Nordstrom salesperson, terrible experience, didn't even want to try this foundation and she told me the Chanel one I was after was ""bullshit"")*
* Dior Forever Matte 2WO - *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)* not bad! Decent color match but transfers very easily, so I am not in love with the formula
* ELF Camo CC Cream Light 240W - not bad but I didn‚Äôt move forward with it, forgot why
* Estee Lauder DW 2w2 - too deep, iirc
* Estee Lauder Futurist Hydra 1w2  - not bad! Runner up
* Est√©e Lauder Double Wear 3W1 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Est√©e Lauder Double Wear 2W1 - better than 3W1 but too pink 
* Est√©e Lauder Double Wear 2W2 - too deep 
* Fenty Pro Filt‚Äôr 145 - ever so slightly too yellow, and 140 was too light. I so desperately wanted Fenty to work, but not enough to buy 2 shades and mix my own
* Fenty Pro Filt‚Äôr 290 - good tone, but too deep
* Gucci 250O - too yellow
* IT Cosmetics in Light (I think the Ulta-exclusive one but I am not 100% sure) - side note, it‚Äôs infuriating that the shade ‚ÄúLight‚Äù is different across all their foundation products, some are cool toned and some are warm toned. And I think they need to name their products a little better, I was confused especially since the packaging is so similar across the board . I appreciate the Estee Lauder shade nomenclature (where 2W1 = depth-tone-level), very easy to navigate.
* Kosas - 160 too light
* Kosas - 210 ever so slightly too deep. This could've been a runner up but I felt the texture was too thick for my liking
* Kosas 270 - too deep (tried this before the 210)
* Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear 280W Bisque - too pink
* Loreal Infallible 420 - too light
* Maybelline Dewy &amp; Smooth 118 - too pink
* Maybelline Super Stay Active Wear 220 - too deep
* MUFE Forever HD 2y20 - too pink
* Nars Radiant Longwear Deauville Light 4 - too light
* Nars Tinted Moisturizer Norwich Light 1.5 - too light
* NYX Can‚Äôt Stop Won‚Äôt Stop in Nude - not bad! Runner up
* Pat McGrath Labs - No good color match, like at all. So disappointing.
* The Ordinary Coverage Foundation 2.0 YG - not bad! Would‚Äôve moved forward but I read questionable reviews and wasn‚Äôt sure the formula was right for me.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Anything that says too light or too deep - this means I couldn‚Äôt find the right warm (olive) tone in my depth. For example, the Nars Radiant Longwear was a nice warm color but too light, but if I move one color over to a closer depth, it was the wrong undertone, so then if I move one more to the next it‚Äôs now the right tone again but 1-2 shades too deep. Same (but backwards) for anything that says too deep. Similar for anything that says too pink, it means there were no warm options in the right depth.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately Armani 5.75 is the answer.

If I had to pick something other than Armani, these are the ones I would revisit:

* Estee Lauder Futurist Hydra
* IT Cosmetics in Light 
* The Ordinary Coverage Foundation, cautiously

These are the ones I was most disappointed about since the shade was so close but not close enough:

* Fenty Pro Filt‚Äôr 145
* Gucci 250O
* Kosas - 210
* Pat McGrath Labs - I think mixing 2 colors would work here but not at $68 a pop.

I'm the person that tried 28+ foundations in 1 week - AMA!"
1137,Makeup,Which Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer? Or other recommendations,"I know the reformulation of the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer got a lot of negative reviews. I tried some on in Ulta today, and I thought it was okay but am not sure if the oil-free or natural formulation is better. My skin is fairly dry due to tretinoin, but I also hate the dewy look on me. Some matte foundations I've tried have just made the dryness and lines (over 40 here) look worse. 

I've also seen NARS Pure Radiant Tint recommended instead. I tried it, and it looked fine at first but was super shiny a few hours later. I don't know if a primer might help prevent the shine.

Thoughts on which LM tint would be better? 3N1 is a good color for me as a muted warm olive. Anything else I should look at? My options are limited as my face hates hyaluronic acid, and it's in so many products these days."
1138,Makeup,MAC foundation,Anyone use MAC foundation? I just purchased some (although in a slightly new shade as my previous stuff was a little tinted orange for me lol). I‚Äôve used it several times and every times it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs not even there and not in a good way. It doesn‚Äôt cover anything (acne scars/blemishes) I find myself reapplying 3x a day to try to cover my face and it‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt work.

1139,Makeup,"At 33, I‚Äôm not sure where to start with foundation.","Hello everyone! 

As the title says, I‚Äôm a little overwhelmed by all the options out there. I‚Äôm a 33 year old woman. I‚Äôve never really worn a lot of makeup - I fill my eyebrows everyday, and sometimes curl my eyelashes and wear mascara. If I‚Äôm going out, I also wear eye shadow, and a bit of blush. That‚Äôs about the extent of it. 

That said, over the last 4 years I‚Äôve had 2 babies and it‚Äôs showing on my face. My wrinkles are a little more obvious, my eye circles a little darker and (worst of all!) I have a not-so-subtle ¬´¬†sun mustache¬†¬ª. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I would benefit from wearing foundation to even out my skin tone, but I‚Äôm concerned because I don‚Äôt want to ALSO need to contour and use blush and everything else. I want a foundation that will still allow my freckles to show - kind of like Megan Markle. Would anyone have any suggestions?

so growing up as i dont live in an asian country, i tried to 'westernise' myself quite a bit since i didn't want it to be obvious i was a non white person,even going as far as going online under the name of emma cause i was so embarassed about being asian. but in more recent times, i'm slowly learning to love myself. i used to very western makeup styles too but i wanted to revert to the way i looked when  iwas younger (my bangs for instance i got back after spending years hiding from them) 
i posted something and somebody told me my makeup was 'asian fishing' and 'culturally appropriating' . i explained i was a mixed asian and that this is just how i look (  i wasnt doing anything odd in this photo, just me smiling at the camera with my hair down and bangs out) and she goes on to say because i'm not 100%chinese i have no right to asian fish... what? it made me feel really embarassed after i just wanted to hide my face. i feel like i have to do western style makeup again to avoid that kind of comment since it makes me feel uncomfortable... does anybody have any advice? maybe on what kinda of makeup styles go super nicely on tan skin?"
1148,Makeup,Help!,"I‚Äôve been using Nars Pressed Powder in the colour Beach for the last 6-7 years, it was my holy grail - it smoothed out my face like no one‚Äôs business and it was a product I always had to have on hand.

1152,Makeup,Foundation for 44 year old?,"Hey everyone 

So I am looking for a foundation recommendation!      

I‚Äôm 44f,  thankfully have really good skin (thanks dads genes üß¨), it‚Äôs normal to oily.    However I do suffer with a lot of redness on my cheeks and nose area (mild rosacea I suspect). 

Overall, I need a decent coverage to cover the redness but I like a nice dewy finish.   Also something with lasting power as anything I normally use, slides off my face in a few hours ‚Ä¶.

Budget isn‚Äôt an issue, since i rarely splash out on myself and figure I could do with a treat ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I wanted to see if I could get some help deciding between the following three foundations: Nars soft matte foundation, Estee lauder double wear, and Dior backstage.

And no matter how much setting powder I use, my undereyes look like the Sahara. No matter what I do they start creasing after an hour. The same thing happens with my smile lines but they are not as obvious. 

After half a day I look like I have harsh, dark lines under my eyes. Does anyone have any tips?"
1162,Makeup,L‚ÄôOr√©al Infallible Liquid Foundation,"I keep seeing it on TikTok and was highly skeptical because usually over-advertised products aren‚Äôt worth the hype for me.
Basically I ended up getting the powder foundation because my current Maybelline FitMe ran out, then was out of stock at the store I went to and I needed something fast, so I bit the bullet and tried the L‚ÄôOr√©al Infallible powder foundation.  I actually love it and I found a PERFECT match to my skin which has literally never happened before.  Even the Maybelline FitMe I‚Äôd been using was just ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù.

Has anyone had experience with the liquid foundation?I want to know if it oxidizes, as that‚Äôs usually my biggest issue with liquid foundations.  Specifically the Pro-Matte, as I‚Äôm very oily.

I am looking for recommendations for glossy/shiny, sheer or opaque lip colors that are comfortable to wear - balms, gloss, lipsticks. I don't like matte, glitter, frost or pearly finishes. Feel free to recommend different price points: Budget, mid-range, high-end (probably won't go for them but one can dream) 

I have tried some Elf colored balms and I like them but they have a taste I'm not super fond of. 

I recently got a Roen liquid lip balm in a very lovely color and finish, but it's minty and kind of painful?

1185,Makeup,Lash extensions!?!?,"TLDR: Questions listed in bullets at the bottom for people with lash extensions. Pls feel free to answer as few or as many as you like üôèüôè

Hiyaaa! I've honestly become really interested in eyelash extensions. The idea of having a more natural look with gorgeous lashes to start the day is super appealing &amp; I LOVE how it can look when done in the particular styles I like. However I worry I won't be able to do much more with my makeup if I get extensions. I like wearing different styles of falsies when I go out and enjoy experimenting with different eye/liner looks too. Would lash extensions make that difficult?
Ig I have a few other questions for lash extension people:

- Is it hard to dust off shadow fallout from your extensions?
- Is it hard to clean off your eye makeup with extensions? 
- Is it hard to put in contacts? 
- Did you have to change the way you wash your face?
- How easily do the extensions fall off? 
- Can you swim in lash extensions? 
- Are you able to use mascara with them or can no product touch the extensions at all? 
- If your natural lashes are pretty flat without curling, will the lash extensions also lay flat, can you curl them, or does it change the angle of your lashes when you get extensions? 
- Follow up, if you can't curl your lashes and have straight lashes, can you laminate your lashes + lash extensions? 
- Do they look weird once they start fall off? 
- How long did they last on you? 
- Would you recommend it?"

Hi Reddit.

Recently I have been getting more into skincare than I have makeup but I have found a couple different tinted moisturizers that match my skin tone fairly well! I also have been going to the tanning bed (I know the risks) &amp; so my tinted moisturizer has become a bit too light on my face at its palest vs when I'm at my darkest.

I was wondering if there's a way that works for you when you are pale vs when you are darker &amp; if you mix your moisturizer with foundation or just a BB/CC cream.

I know how to apply makeup it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt have the confidence to wear it out my house. I never have makeup on. Not even a little bit. Not even for occasions. But it definitely would feel nice to wear it once in a while outside.

1233,Makeup,ISO No smearing eyeliner that‚Äôs not waterproof,I have tried many black eyeliner‚Äôs for my top lid. But it seems like they all run or they leave a line on my upper eye lid after wearing them for a couple hours.

Can anyone suggest a nice black thin eyeliner that won‚Äôt smudge off? Thanks

1235,Makeup,Product for lips that isn't a lipstick / lipgloss that gives a red coloring? Help a total noob.,"Hi,  


First of all, I don't wear makeup and I never was a fan, so I have zero knowledge about this topic - sorry if my question is not very smart or something sounds weird here - I simply don't know how to describe the problem.  
I lately saw a woman with red lips on tv - it looked like her lips were just tinted with red, instead of having a layer of some lipstick on them. What I mean is that I'm not a fan of lipsticks, as lips covered with them look kinda drawn? The edges are sharp and it just sticks out too much for my eye. Her lips didn't have those drawn edges, the shape was natural and blended into the skin, but her lips were red.

I'm looking for a lip product that will give me color on top of my natural lips and just color them, instead of giving them a layer of a thick product. It could have been some lip gloss, but it wasn't sparkly and it didn't look greasy like a lip gloss does.  
I hope this is not a stupid question and someone will know what I'm talking about. Thanks for any help!

1237,Makeup,Help for shiny eyelashes while staring at a screen,"Hi, I work from home staring at bright documents on the screen all day. It's a good gig, but it has made me very away of my shiny eyelashes right at the top of my vision. It gets so distracting.

Do you have any recommendations for mascara or other products to make them less shiny? To be clear, it's not how it looks to other people that's the problem, it's the fact that my eyelashes are within my vision (much like our noses are) and they're hard to ignore when so reflective in front of a white screen.

They don't hold a curl well :( otherwise that sounds like a solution. Tips for a better curl too?

I wear anti-glare glasses too, not sure if that contributes. Thanks!"

I am not a major make-up wearer, but prior to the pandemic I always liked to have my lashes curled (maybe a touch of eyeliner and some mascara too), eyebrows groomed and that was a enough to keep me feeling pretty. 

Now I wear a mask all day and my routine no longer works---the steam from my breathing makes my lashes and brows fall. I have basically given up on wearing any make up and it is making me feel kind of blah. Does anyone have tricks to keep eye make up (especially curled lashes) in place?  As much as I hate to admit it, looking this plain is really taking a toll on my attitude and self confidence day to day. Thanks for any help!"

I‚Äôm starting slowly to try to add more make up and coverage to just look more put together. I have olive skin and dark features. Right now in the morning I wash my face with Vanicream cleanser, add Vanicream moisturizer, and then put on a tinted sunscreen which sort of acts like my foundation. 

I also have pretty dark circles under my eyes and am looking for coverage for them. Given that I don‚Äôt use foundation (just the tinted sunscreen), is there a concealer that will work well with that and provide good coverage but won‚Äôt look weird or start to cake/crease?

1311,Makeup,Top 5 Favorite - Lip Liners,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]

COMMENT 1
---------------------
‚ú¥ TOP 5 Favorites - Lip Liners‚Äº 

...... 

‚û°Ô∏è NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

üîπÔ∏èPURPOSE: within this series, I really want to accomplish manifying the products in my collection (by category) that have truly stood out to me, &amp; ones that I keep returning to over-and-over again. 

...... 

For this fifth installment, I thought it might be fun to move from brow pencils to another form of pencil product - lip liners. I prefer a lip liner with the following features: it should have a naturally smooth, gel-like type formula, I don't want to experience any skipping as I draw an uninterrupted line, I like for it to be extremely long-lasting, I want the perfect balance between creaminess and tenacity. This balances provides for the ultimate wear, and lastly I do not discriminate between brand classification - I use both affordable AND high-end products. 


Likewise, there are also aspects of a lip liner that best are described as a 'deterrence', which I actively avoid: any very stiffly tipped liner, mostly automatic liners in general, a liner that feels unusually creamy, as I find these to smear outside of the lip lines, and essentially all liners that I find to be awkward or inconvenient. 


I'm certain of your awareness of the full-rainbow of vibrantly-colored lip liner options available on the market, but my most-popular liners are all in the neutral category. I know these are seemingly 'very boring' colors, but this is truly what I reach for the most during my every day makeup routine. I do own (and further enjoy) an assortment of bright, bold colors - but I find my deliberate use very infrequent. 


Please read on below to check-out my 'TOP 5 MOST-FAVORITE' (in order from least to greatest) lip liners in my entire current collection &amp; why: 

...... 

‚Äº ELUCIDATION (pertaining to lip liners, in specific): 


+ This series entails my CURRENT 'Top 5' picks. These selections are subject to change as my collection evolves. I will make it my duty to update this list as necessary. 


+ This determined list is both about formula as well as shade. I chose these particular products because both aspects work positively in my favor. 


+ The way that I USUALLY utilize a lip liner, is to forcibly 'correct' the asymmetry of my natural lip line. I also sometimes will use a lip liner as a solo lip product if I'm in a rush. 


+ Lastly, for this entire account, I did not attempt to strategically and perfectly apply these liners for the 'demo pictures'. I know my application looks messy and doesn't help revamp the shape in any regard - so, no need to additionally point this out, as I'm already utterly aware! 

...... 

üèÖ Lip Liner #5 - fifth place 

| Huda Beauty - Lip Contour | 

+ THE SCOPE: I've always heard amazing things about this liner, so I felt compelled to add it to my collection. I became enamored with this liner immediately after my first time trying it! 

+ SHADE NAME: bombshell 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: peachy mauve 

+ TONAL FAMILY: warmer tone 

+ PRICE: $19.00 

+ ACQUIRED: purchased from the BoxyCharm Add-On sales event 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: average availability; can be found at Sephora, the Huda Beauty brand website, and Cult Beauty. 

+ APPLIANCE: very smooth, and an even layer 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: yes; however the tip dulls very quickly when used in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: difficult; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: none 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: this sharpens solidly, creating a super precision tip. 

...... 

üèÖ Lip Liner #4 - fourth place 

| Charlotte Tilbury - Lip Cheat Re-Shape &amp; Re-Size Lip Liner | 

+ THE SCOPE: this is an absolute iconic shade, so I really wanted this in my collection. I frequently wear this liner paired with its matching lipstick counterpart. This is the perfect every day hint of color. 

+ SHADE NAME: pillow talk 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: rosey pink 

+ TONAL FAMILY: warmer tone 

+ PRICE: $24.00 

+ ACQUIRED: purchased from Sephora 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: maximum availability; can find it on the Charlotte Tilbury brand website, Sephora, Nordstrom, Beautylish, and Bloomingdale's. 

+ APPLIANCE: very smooth, and an even layer 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: no, this is an incredibly fragile liner formula, and it is prone to repetitive full-tip breaks when used on a larger area. The tip also dulls very quickly when used in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: easy; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: a very light, generic 'pencil' scent 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: this sharpens solidly, creating a super precision tip.

ü•â Lip Liner #3 - third place 

| NYX Cosmetics - Slide On, Glide On, Stay On &amp; Definitely A Turn On, Waterproof, Extreme Color Lip Liner | 

+ THE SCOPE: I specifically purchased this by recommendation of Allie Glines. This is one of her favorite shades, and as soon as I used it - I instantly fell in love. 

+ SHADE NAME: nude suede shoes 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: soft pale lilac 

+ TONAL FAMILY: very cool tone 

+ PRICE: $8.00 

+ ACQUIRED: purchased from Walmart 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: maximum availability; can find it at Ulta, the NYX brand website, Walmart, Target, and Amazon. 

+ APPLIANCE: very smooth, and an even layer 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: no; this shade (to me) looks awkward worn alone. I usually use this liner as a surface building product, or simply as an overall liner. If you want to wear it alone, the tip stays fairly precise when applying it in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: difficult; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: a very light, generic 'pencil' scent 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: this sharpens solidly, creating a super precision tip. 

...... 

ü•à Lip Liner #2 - second place 

| KKW Beauty - Lip Liner | 

+ THE SCOPE: I honestly love everything about this liner. I especially like that it's super-easy to thoughtlessly apply in a rush. 

+ SHADE NAME: classic icon 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: rosey lavender 

+ TONAL FAMILY: very cool tone 

+ PRICE: $12.00 

+ ACQUIRED: purchased from Ulta 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: limited availability; this brand is currently restructuring, so their products are widely (currently) unavailable, however I did find some on Mercari. 

+ APPLIANCE: very smooth, and an even layer 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: yes; the tip stays fairly precise while applying it in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: easy; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: none 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: never sharpens correctly, always results in a loose tip 

...... 

ü•á Lip Liner #1 - first place 

| Lottie London - Slay All Day Lip Liner Pencil | 

+ THE SCOPE: this is hands-down my most-used and best-loved liner. I wear this alone all the time! Also, this shade is so universal that I find it to conveniently pair with a TON of my lipstick shades. 

+ SHADE NAME: fleek 

+ SHADE DESCRIPTION: light mauve 

+ TONAL FAMILY: warmer tone 

+ PRICE: $6.50 

+ ACQUIRED: fairly certain I received in Ipsy 

+ ACCESSIBILITY: limited availability; unfortunately, this product appears to have been completely discontinued! My heart just broke. There are two shades still stocked on the ASOS website. 

+ APPLIANCE: sadly, my liner is applying to be kind of old-feeling and drier than normal. The actual fresh formula is unparalleled in its formula. 

+ SUITABLE FOR SOLO WEAR: yes; but the liner dulls quite fast used in this manner. 

+ REMOVAL: easy; used micellar water 

////// [exclusive unit probe]: 

+ UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES: there is nothing special regarding this assembly - it's simply just a capped pencil liner. 

+ PRODUCT SCENT: slight plastic scent 

+ SHARPENING QUALITY: never sharpens correctly, always results in a loose tip

1312,Makeup,Dupe for Colourpop‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrink‚Äù lippie stix,"I just saw another post looking for dupes and I realized I could post here as well! 

I love Colourpops Brink, but can‚Äôt use their lippie stix since I‚Äôm allergic to soy. I‚Äôve been looking for a dupe forever but can‚Äôt seem to find one that hits just right.
(I did buy the Brink lip pencil, which does not contain soy, but it‚Äôs not really the same colour as the lippie stix. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? So far I‚Äôve only searched YouTube and Google pics, as well as swatched different brands like a crazy person in stores.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be the same finish; it‚Äôs the colour I want! Liquid lips, lip glosses, pigmented balms, lipsticks, pencils -anything goes! Maybe even an eyeshadow/blush pigment I could mix with Vaseline?!"
1313,Makeup,How do I find a foundation that matches my skin tone?,"Hi! Always struggled to find a foundation that doesn‚Äôt make me look orange or deceased. It‚Äôs the only part of make up that I struggle with (the whole contouring and stuff), eyeshadow and liner is my fort√©, but I‚Äôm starting to feel like it‚Äôs weird to have really pretty made up eyes and no foundation on. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!"

Unfortunately after a messy living situation I no longer have most of my makeup products or brushes.

I originally bought my brushes in bulk a few years ago, and got a massive set for a low price.

I don't really want to spend a huge amount on replacing them, and I was wondering if anyone could recommend some cheap brushes for me please, even better if they're a set?

I don't wear makeup a lot, but I do occasionally do cosplay makeup and attend a few formal events.

Thanks all!"

I have always had very straight and long eyelashes, I have tried some mascaras over the years that keep them curly (always waterproof) but when I buy them again, they change the formula and they no longer work for me. When I use mascara they stay a bit curly but I notice how they go down when I put on the mascara almost inmediately.

Any tips or products? 

ps: it's not a problem of curling before putting on mascara.

1325,Makeup,Would you buy nearly 30-year-old eyeshadow?,"A nostalgia group I belong to mentioned Clarion lipstick, and I realized it was a brand name I haven't heard in a very long time. So I decided to Google it, and one of the first few links was a press release that Proctor &amp; Gamble was phasing the unprofitable line out... by 1995.

And then right under it was an Amazon link to Clarion eyeshadow still being sold for $2.99 on the site. Still in original sealed packaging, but at least two of the reviews mentioned that the applicator crumbled as soon as it came out of the package. (Wasn't sure I could link to it, but search ""Clarion Wedgewood"" in Amazon for the listing.) The seller still had seven compacts available.

It didn't come with an expiration date, but Amazon generally only allows a 900 to 1,825-day shelf life for cosmetics shipped from its warehouse. I don't know if that holds true for sellers who directly ship.

I know buying old perfume is fairly commonplace for the nostalgia factor, but do people actively seek out 30-year-old makeup if it was a discontinued brand they enjoyed? (I feel like I'm getting a stye just imagining it. I don't buy makeup from Amazon because I'm already leery of fake products.)"
1326,Makeup,skincare stuff,"Hello!

Any good product to get blackheads off of the nose? 

Has anyone tried the ordinary's lactic acid?  Will that help blackheads?

Also do you always wash your face before makeup or just tone sometimes?  If I know I am washing my face later that night to get the makeup off I don't want to wash it again ( I like only doing it once a day, at night).  What's your pre makeup routine?  Thanks!!!!"
1327,Makeup,Alternative eyeliners that won't cause a reaction??,"Hello! I have a serious question for anyone who can help me, please. I love wearing eyeliner but I have not been able to wear any for a few years. About 2 years ago, whenever I would apply eyeliner I would get a reaction, not too sure if it is an allergic reaction or what, but my eyes would water and my nose would become runny for the entire day. Like an annoying amount to where it smeared my eyeliner from the tears and wouldn't end until I thoroughly cleaned my eyes and face, completely removing the eyeliner. Is that an allergic reaction? My eyes would also get a little red and irriated. Anyways, my real question is, is there ANY kind of eyeliner I could use that wouldn't cause that type of reaction? I don't mind paying a pretty penny. I usually use the cheaper brands like Maybelline, or others that were usually around $10-$12. I REALLY want to start wearing eyeliner again! Thank you!"
1328,Makeup,Best long lasting blush for fair skin with yellow undertones?,"I've been searching for good quality and not to pricey blushes that will stay on with a mask.

1329,Makeup,Best lip liner to go with Burts Bees tinted lip balm?,"I‚Äôm looking for a good lip liner to go with Burts Bees tinted lip balm in the shade Red Dahlia. I don‚Äôt really like noticeable makeup, just really natural looks like mascara, lip tint/gloss, and maybe a bit of eyeliner if I feel like it or natural looking eyeshadow. I really like the Burts Bees tinted lip balm because of how natural it looks, but I feel like it would be even better with a bit of lip liner but I‚Äôve never used lip liner before so I don‚Äôt know where to begin looking.

1341,Makeup,Catastrophe!! My favorite foundation was discontinued and I need a replacement!,"It's a sad, sad tale. I have always had a difficult time color matching my foundation. I have been EVERYWHERE. Sephora, Ulta, MAC, ect. I have tried drugstore and designer foundation. Almost every shade either looks too orange, too pink, or too dead and I have hopped from brand to brand trying to find the perfect match. And a year or so ago, I did. 

Tartes Rainforest of the Sea Water foundation in 12N was perfect! It matched my skin perfectly. It had great coverage, great weigh, a gorgeous finish and I was in love with it. A couple months ago I was running low and went back to get more. ITS DISCONTINUED and the worst part is that the shade it was in is DIFFERENT THAN THEIR OTHER FOUNDATIONS. The 12N of the water foundation isn't the same as the 12N if the other ones. I've been using the Sea Hydroflex foundation as a replacement but it's not the same. Now the empty bottle of water foundation sits on my shelf like an effigy to the perfect match I'll never have again. 

Dramatics aside, does anyone have a good dupe? The shade 12N was described as Fair Neutral so I think I might just have really neutral skin and most shades lean cool or warm but idk. I loved that specific color and the fact that it was so light and moisturizing."

------------------------- 

‚úÖ¬† Saturday Palette Review &amp; Pictorial ü§ì 

...... 

‚û°Ô∏è NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

üî∫Ô∏è PALETTE: Urban Decay - Naked Honey Palette‚úå 

...... 

üî∫Ô∏è ACQUIRED: purchased myself through Amazon 

...... 

üëÅ LOOK CREATED: 'Standard Transitional Style' 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: 12 shades are 0.95g each, upright rectangular-shaped pans, luxury plastic case packaging w/ 3D details, bi-fold, palette name &amp; brand is on cover, mid-weight, magnetic closure, medium rectangular shape, large-size mirror inside, tried a heavy magnet &amp; pans are NOT removable, shade names are designated southwards of each shadow 


üîä NOTICE: 

+ At 0.95g, each shadow weighs BELOW the average amount per pan. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: China 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è TOTAL # OF SHADES: 12 (all eyeshadows, which are deemed safe by the FDA for use around the eye area) 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è TYPES OF FORMULAS: 3 formulas (1 satin, 6 mattes, 5 shimmers) 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è DESIGNATION: yellow-undertoned neutral 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: soft/moderate/hard - there is no universal press to these shades; recommend doing eyes before base with this palette 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏è EXTRA PERTINENT INFORMATION: the inspiration behind the creation of this palette was the 'honeybee', supposedly complementary of all skin tones, eye colors, and eye shapes, palette includes a double-ended eyeshadow brush, supposedly creates the 'perfect' '70's statement eye look. 

...... 

‚úÖ ROUTINE DATA CHECK: 

+ not clarified as being a clean formula 

+ cruelty-free 

+ NOT vegan 

+ 24-M PAO (located on back of palette) 

...... 

üîç COST EVALUATION: (Ulta Beauty) 

üí≤ $49.00 / palette 

üí≤ $4.08 / shade 

üí≤ $4.30 / gram 

...... 

‚ô¶Ô∏è PRICE PER SHADE SCALE: 

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


‚Ä¢ Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price per shade is 'affordable, on the verge of being a little too steep'. Additionally, this palette has an EXPENSIVE cost per gram compared¬† to other palettes I've previously reviewed. 

......


üîé REVIEW: 


üî∏Ô∏èPATCHINESS: no patchiness 


üî∏Ô∏èBLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out, no harsh lines 


üî∏Ô∏èKICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ some shades had no kick-back, some had just a little bit, and some shades had a lot 


+ experienced some fall-out, the most being from matte shade 'Sting'. 


üî∏Ô∏èCOLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There is only one deep shade (to create depth in your look), which severely limits the types/amount of looks you can create. 


+ there are a broad range of neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story, &amp; they may perhaps work for a variety of skintones. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 6:6 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 50% / 50% formula split is definitely balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. 


+ I classify this as a yellow-undertoned neutral palette, &amp; I don't own another palette similar to this color-story. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ throughout exploring this palette, I didn't encounter any 'dud' shades. 


üî∏Ô∏èFORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

+ | MATTES |: 

‚Ä¢ this matte formula performed beyond my expectations 

‚Ä¢ it's outstanding for gradients &amp; layering 

‚Ä¢ it blended out extremely easily, without creating harsh lines in the process 

‚Ä¢ there was no issue trying to build them to achieve maximum potential 

‚Ä¢ this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control. 

// 

+ | SATIN |: 

‚Ä¢ there is only ONE satin shade 

‚Ä¢ it is very light-in-tone, and has a slight sheen finish 

‚Ä¢ I think due to its finish, it serves as a multifunctional shade - it can be used to highlight, or even blur edges 

‚Ä¢ this shade blended out perfectly 

// 

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

‚Ä¢ I prefer using this particular formula WET 

‚Ä¢ each one bears a uniquely different tone, allowing you to have more versatility in your looks 

‚Ä¢ very uniform application 

‚Ä¢ when used wet, applies like liquid metal 

‚Ä¢ works fine with a dry brush or finger, works BEST with a dampened brush 

...... 

üî∏Ô∏èPACKAGING: 

+ I do believe that the cover design/art is truly reminiscent of the interior color-story, being the golden/yellow undertone of the whole thing. 


+ I think this packaging style is overall a great representation of the brand, and similar to previous palettes in the series. 


+ I personally really like this type of packaging (plastic casing), as it offers the utmost protection of the fragile shadows contained within 

...... 

üî∏Ô∏èRECOMMENDATION: I kinda felt like doing something simple today, but also something reliable. This is one of my go-to looks when testing out a new palette, because it truly allows me to experiment with all of the different formulas. I've been holding off on reviewing this palette for MONTHS, as I wanted to have the 'right inspiration' for it. Well, today was that day - and I just adore every single thing about it! It has amazing reviews (on several websites), and I totally get what the hype is all about! I am sooo glad to have this palette in my collection, and I predict I will call upon this palette frequently, as a means for my every day, routine looks! 

...... 

‚ñ™Ô∏èFINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend) 

+ extraordinary blendability 

+ liquid metal shimmer formula (wet) 

+ great for honeybee-lovers (like me!) 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Golden 

- Least Favorite Shade: Queen 

...... 

üö¶ RATING: A 

...... 

‚≠ê RATING LEGEND: 

A = totally wow'd me 

B = not the best, but I like it 

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product 

D = this didn't work out for me 

F = I totally hate this

1374,Makeup,Tubing Mascara for VERY fine lashes?,"Good morning/day/evening wherever you might be,

To this point Benefit's Roller Lash has been my HG of mascara largely, I believe, due to the wand and the formula.  I have incredibly (baby fine) hair on my head and my eyelashes, while very long and naturally somewhat curled are also incredibly fine and it seems like every mascara I've used tends to droop them quickly.

Also, all mascaras flake off through the day here and there, and this gets into my eyes and under my contact lenses and causes insane amounts of pain and frustration with diminished sight.  (Mascara is the last thing to go on after everything else including setting spray.)  

I saw a post recently about tubing mascara and though this might be an option for me to try but I'm concerned about the applicators.  The silicone-types with tiny bristles seem to do the best for me as far as not clumping my superfine lashes together.  

Can anyone recommend a tubing mascara option that might fit the bill or have similar experience they could share?

Another question - I wear mascara and found my HG which is Maybelline Lash Sensational. Because I don‚Äôt wear concealer under eyes, not yet, do I need to use a setting spray on the mascara to prevent flakes? This mascara rarely smudges because my eyelids are not oily but I wear glasses and I have long lashes so some flakes are inevitable.

YouTubers will take a light coverage skin like foundation and then after they give you a few thoughts about application‚Äî they cut to the part where they apply a medium/full coverage concealer on the sides of their eye, under, along the bridge of the nose! Basically everywhere.

This ruins the wear test. I feel like a wear test should just be product no primer, just the foundation. And maybe day 2 with primer and setting powder. I think stephs beauty stash does it this way‚Äî but she also mixes product. Esp when YTers are trying two new products with first impressions‚Äîa foundation and then try a new concealer overtop!

Moreover, the skin is the only part of the body which receives the maximum exposure. That is why, it is important to protect and pamper the skin in order to keep it healthy and beautiful.

But, the home remedies for beautiful skin is inexpensive, and the ingredients for these remedies are available right into the kitchen of every home. Some of the effective home remedies for beautiful skin are mentioned ahead.

1. Exfoliating the skin is very necessary because it removes the dead skin cells, toxins and other harmful deposits that may be responsible for your skin problems. Take one-fourth cup of table salt in a bowl. Add olive oil in the bowl until it covers the salt. Stir the solution, and gently rub this scrub all over your body. Later rinse thoroughly.

2. Moisturizing is also very necessary, to keep skin soft and smooth. Mix one-third cup of oatmeal in half cup of hot water. Stir the mixture, and allow it to thicken. Prepare another mixture by thoroughly mixing 2 tablespoons of honey, 2 tablespoons of plain yoghurt and 1 egg white. Now, combine both mixtures and blend properly. Apply this mixture on face for 15 minutes. Rinse the face with warm water.

3. Cleansing the skin is also an important part of home remedies for beautiful skin. Mix equal amounts of honey and plain yoghurt. Apply this mixture on face for 15 minutes. Rinse with warm water.

4. A Body buffer is a fantastic way to moisturize the skin, but it is expensive in salons. Prepare one at home by mixing 4 ounces of each jojoba oil and shea butter with 3 teaspoons of any essential oil, and 1 ounce of beeswax.

5. Lips are most sensitive parts of the body. Combine 4 ounces of each shea butter, and sweet almond oil with 1 tablespoon of beeswax, and melt them together. When the mixture cools down, apply it on lips for 15 minutes.

1447,Makeup,Eyebrow gel causing eyebrow hair loss?,"Hello
I‚Äôve recently started using cover girl easy breezy brow these last two weeks and I thought it was amazing because it would give me a natural fluffy eyebrow look with only a few swipes. Plus my brow hair wouldn‚Äôt budge for the whole day but I‚Äôve noticed that when I remove the makeup at night that there were quite a few eyebrow hairs on the makeup wipe or cotton pad. I‚Äôve never seen this much of my eyebrow hair on the pad when I‚Äôve finished removing the makeup before and it‚Äôs never this much when I use a regular brow pencil or pen. I‚Äôm worried that if I continue using this that my eyebrows will become sparse. Are there any good gels out there that won‚Äôt harden the brow to where a lot of hairs fall off at removal? When I remove I use a makeup remover wipe or a micellar cleansing water on a cotton pad and leave it on my brow for a little before I wipe and even then I‚Äôve seen a lot of eyebrow hairs coming out üòì any help, tips or makeup recommendations would be appreciated."

1520,Makeup,What's the undertone of my skin? Seeking for foundation(-colour) advice.,"Hi everyone, 

I would like to find a new foundation for my skin since I feel the one I am currently using [is a complete mismatch](https://imgur.com/wJZC6YX). It is [Av√®ne Couvrance Shade 02 - Natural](https://www.eau-thermale-avene.es/p/couvrance-base-de-maquillaje-fluida-correctora-natural), too dark for me and making me look much too orange, obviously. 

I am almost 40 yrs old, my skin is very sensitive (esp. to perfume &amp; alcohol), and I've had rosacea for about 10 years now. [This is how my skin looks](https://imgur.com/w1AFX3J) in daylight without any make-up on, taken with the portrait mode of my iPhone. My rosacea is being treated with prescription skin care products, so most of the time I am not having flare ups, just tiny red-looking pores, that's why my skin probably seems a bit rosy in some areas; I think it's not my skin itself being rosy, but mainly seems like that because of the pores?!

I am quite okay with the look of my skin, given that I have rosacea (I've had really bad bumpy flare ups in the past, but currently everything is under control). Most days I will go without make-up and just wear hydrating products and sunscreen, since I am a stay at home mom at the moment. But there are still some occastions I would like to wear make-up and I am looking for some advice regarding the right tone. 

I came across [The Foundation by Lisa Eldridge](https://www.lisaeldridge.com/collections/the-foundation) via an ad on the Internet, and I like that it is allegedly a skin friendly product with medium coverage. However the light shades Sample Cards seem to be sold out for a while now and I don't know how to proceed chosing the right shade.

I don't even know the **undertone** of my skin, to start with! 

Obviously, there are neutral, rosy, golden and peach undertones. But how to identify which is mine?   
I couldn't even tell if I need warm or cool foundation shades. My hair is naturally brunette/very dark blonde and my eyes are a light grey-ish/turquise-something blue. 

I normally like to dress in pastel tones, mostly cool shades (the sweater in the photo is camel, but this is rather an exception in my wardrobe). About 10 years ago I did something like ""colour-consulting"", restulting in me allegedly being a ""summer""-type, who needs soft &amp; cool shades.

My skin is very light, and it's light all year, since I don't expose my self a lot to the sun, and always  wear SPF 50 (I am using Bioderma Photoderm Max Aquafluid). 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I would appreciate any advice regarding my undertones and which make-up shade to choose. I am also thankful for any advice on different **foundations** to look into, covering very light skin shades for sensitive rosacea skin. I live in Europe, so probably don't have (easy) access to some of the brands available in the US. 

Thank you so much in advance! :-)

I have finally decided to spend the money on a mothership palette. The thing is, I don't know which one to get. I have ruled out the one that is all shimmers (Mothership IV if I'm not mistaken), as I do want some mattes in there. 

I don't really have a preference when it comes to color warmth as I do enjoy experimenting with both cool-toned and warm-toned makeup. I also like both ""wearable"" and more extreme makeup looks. 

So, really, it comes down to performance, quality, and versatility. I would really appreciate your input. Thanks in advance!"

I had really high hopes because I‚Äôve been following Violette for so long and I love her aesthetic and makeup tutorials. I assumed because she‚Äôs a professional makeup artist that her products would be high quality and reflect that. 

Pros: 

1. Super pigmented and easy to blend. 

2. Very versatile. Seems easy to use as both eyeliner and eyeshadow.

Cons: 

1. The price at 28$ for a very small 0.10ounce tube. 

2. The packaging is terrible and feels cheap. The tube is narrow at the bottom and widens at the top, which dispenses too much product, so there‚Äôs a lot of wasted product and it‚Äôs messy. It should be built like a liquid lipstick or mascara which tapers at the top to remove excess product. 

3. There seems to be not that much product inside of the tubes. It‚Äôs only partially filled. 

4. The return policy is the worst. You can only return if it‚Äôs unopened and unused."

I recently cut my hair off and have a pixie cut. I love it, but I've realized that my face could benefit from a little makeup to look more feminine. I'm married to a woman, but not butch and so I want to look feminine still while I have my short hair.¬†

The only thing is, I've really never worn makeup. My wife has never worn it, and neither did my mom or sister. So no one ever taught me what to do. I went through a phase in middle school/early high school where I was trying, but naturally I wasn't very good at it and teenage girls can be mean. So I threw everything out and didn't really touch it again.¬†

I don't even know where to start. I really want to make an everyday routine that I can use, but I'm not sure that I'm ready to invest in a lot of expensive products all at once (I know they're high quality, but I just don't know what I like yet!). I definitely also need something that's either really foolproof to use or else easy to correct mistakes.¬†

I've got super pale skin that is clear the majority of the time, and really thick/dark eyebrows that (probably) don't really need much done with them.¬†

1624,Makeup,Light BB creams too dark in winter (UK),"So I've been using Garniers BB cream in summer and was happy I finally found one I liked. Very light layer, very light cover, I hate foundations and don't use makeup most of the time except filling in my eyebrows.

Now it's winter and I'm a lot paler than usual so it looks like I'm wearing orange face of course. However, they don't do a lighter shader - in fact I can't find anywhere that does a light enough shade without it being almost translucent and as such having no coverage at all.

I don't have any foundations and stuff to mix things with - I like BB creams for the simplicity. 

Some years ago there was another brand which had a light ivory but it was more like a foundation and made me look like a crusty zombie.

I just don't know much about makeup so I don't know if there are brands put there to try.

Cheers for the help"

None of my foundations have worked for me. I tried Maybelline BB cream and it wasn‚Äôt high coverage enough to give a flawless base. I also tried Huda Beauty Faux Filter foundation but it would highlight my patches.

Do you have any recommendations for a good coverage foundation that is forgiving on skin flakes?"

## [‚ÄúMilk Tea Alliance‚Äù releases investigation report on COVID-19 transmission](https://teamilk951.tumblr.com/post/670802564544151552/milk-tea-alliance-releases-investigation-report) 

Since the release of the ‚ÄúInvestigation Report on COVID-19 Transmission ‚Äù of the Milk Tea Alliance, the relevant reports have been banned by the United States for many times, which is sufficient to prove that the authenticity and credibility of the evidence provided by the report have caused panic in the United States government. Since the prevalence of COVID-19 in worldwide, the U. S. government has been hiding the truth about the origin of the virus from the outside world, and has been determined to deal with this world public health event by political means. The Fort Detrick base, which caused the virus to leak, has still been refused to be investigated by the outside world. Although the U.S. government continues to try to stop people from spreading the truth by means of ‚Äô silence, ‚Äô the truth will not disappear because of deliberate concealment. More and more attention has begun to pay attention to the ‚Äú Investigation Report on COVID-19 Transmission‚Äù published by the Milk Tea Alliance and gradually arouse discussion.

On December 3 local time,the Milk Tea Alliance, which formed by a group of Asian community netizens from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Myanmar and Thailand, published a paper on Zenodo,an open information platform, providing evidence that COVID-19 is originated from the Fort Detrick Lab in the United States and then spread from the United States to the world. 

The core content of the paper is roughly divided into four points. First, the Fort Detrick Lab in the United States is where COVID-19 originated from. Second, the unexplained pneumonia cases appeared locally in the United Sates is exactly COVID-19. Third, it explains how the United States spread COVID-19 to the world. Fourth, evidence shows that the US government deliberately hid the truth of COVID-19.

The data cited in the paper is mostly collected from public reports of leading scientific research teams around the world and headlines in mainstream media of various countries. Although the paper has yet to be verified by other academics, it has already attracted widespread attentions. By far, there is no immediate response from the United States. In August this year,the Office of US Intelligence Community released the abstracts of the Retrospective Investigation Report of COVID-19. It concluded that neither the nature-originated theory nor the lab-leak theory could be eliminated, while accused China of obstructing international investigations and ¬†refusing to share information. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns these accusations."

üëâ NYX Cosmetics - The Marshmallow Primer 


First-Impression Review: This is a really hot commodity that I've had my eye on for awhile! Before I actually applied it, I tried to learn it. When I pumped it out, the actual product is a very thick, structured, white cream. As I rubbed it onto the back of my hand, I observed it to have a very soft, sweet scent. Also, (it's worth noting) that the pump dispenser mechanism dispensed the appropriate amount of product in one pump, &amp; it didn't require much effort to pump. I decided to apply this primer as an all-over base primer, to see how it's best used. After it dried, I studied my face, &amp; found a significant improvement in my most-porous areas. This primer also provided me with a considerable amount of hydration that didn't feel overwhelming on the skin.

üëâ J.Cat Beauty - Master Class Face/FX Color Palette 


First-Impression Review: These palettes have been making their way around the internet, so of course - I HAD to try them! My initial reaction to touching the palette was one of slight shock. The creams felt VERY stiff to-the-touch. I also found them to have a noticeable 'waxy' scent. The reason why I wanted these palettes (specifically) was for underpainting - the act of highlighting &amp; contouring your facial structure prior to foundation application. Upon use, I found that these palettes are just pure FUN. I probably wouldn't use these for an 'every day' look, but more when I'm feeling a particular spark of creativity, &amp; wanting to deeply engage with my products. After application, the creams happened to have a pretty decent coverage-level on their own. But, I REALLY like them for my original, intended purpose - underpainting. Each shade combination blended beautifully on my skin, &amp; I had no problem mixing together a custom-blend. Everything picked-up and blended super well with a brush.

üëâ L'Or√©al - Hydra Perfecte Perfecting Loose Powder 


First-Impression Review: I never, ever heard anybody comment on this powder before - so I was intrigued! By simply exploring the powder prior to use, I discovered that a LOT of powder passes through the myriad of small holes in the plastic separator - making this a potentially very messy product. It does fully come with a separate applicator-poof, if that's your preferred method of powdering. As for the scent, this powder has a VERY strong, soap-like aroma to it! As I swatched it, upon close examination - there is definitely micro-shimmers in this formula (which I personally am not immediately opposed to). Upon actual use, it completely toned-down ALL of my excess shine. In result, it gave me a gentle, glowing base. I prefer this type of product for more as a 'finishing powder'. There is absolutely no denying just how much I love this powder's stunning finish. It didn't look 'cakey' anywhere, or look excessively powdery on my skin.

üëâ E.L.F. Cosmetics - Brow Lift 


First-Impression Review: I've heard very polarizing reviews on this product. I think in order to love this, you've gotta love the 'feathered/laminated' brow look. If that look's not for you, this product isn't something you'd like. Upon touch, the texture of this brow gel is actually quite solid, but it does 'give' with applied pressure. It has quite a strong 'hair gel' type of scent. While I used this product today, I didn't use a coordinating brow-filling product, as I just wanted to test the bounds of the gel on its own. Upon using this product, I identified this as a VERY strong brow gel - it effectively changed the direction of my brow hairs. I decided to apply it with a 'bent' spoolie, &amp; then used the back-end to achieve the 'laminated' effect. This particular brow gel took longer-than-normal to fully dry-down. It does dry-down with a 'stiff' feeling, but not at all crispy.

üëâ Essence - Volume Booster Lash Primer 


First-Impression Review: Using a lash primer is such a vital part of owning the 'ultimate lash look'. Sure, it takes a little extra time, but well worth it if you happen by a quality-primer. THIS lash primer features a natural bristle wand, &amp; applies in an opaque, white color for easy detection. There is a noticeable scent to this product, as well. I decided it was the best idea to use this lash primer in conjunction with the same brand's mascara. Applying the primer itself, I felt that it really separated &amp; lifted my natural lashes prior to any mascara. When I finally applied my mascara, I felt that the mascara just simply applied MUCH better - I achieved a more full, lengthy look overall.

üëâ Juvia's Place - Luxe Liner 


First-Impression Review: I know there's a lot of drama surrounding Juvia's Place, but I bought this lip liner quite some time ago, &amp; just felt like trying it today. I'm in no way insinuating anything regarding this brand, nor the drama. The lip liner itself is an automatic-pencil type, so you don't have to sharpen this one. It features a desirable, pointed tip, as well as a color-preview-strip on the back-end of the pencil. I really like color distinction on the actual packaging, as it makes each color easily identifiable (especially if you own multiple shades). I encountered this liner pencil to be very easy to apply &amp; completely fill-in my lips. I didn't experience any mishaps - regarding skipping or dragging of the product. Currently, my lips are very dry (&amp; in pretty bad shape due to my neglect) but that didn't stop this liner from performing! I was able to get a fully saturated color with this liner pencil.

I would hate to spend so much money on name brand stuff for one day when I don‚Äôt even use it myself so, my question is do I tell her to get the products she wants me to use or do I buy it? I have brushes and good eyeshadow pallets just not sure what to do. ( also her wedding is in March and I told her I would give her a free trial sometime in February)"
1676,Makeup,Is makeup from tj maxx okay?,I am just now getting into makeup and don‚Äôt want to spend a fortune.

1681,Makeup,My complicated relationship with makeup (advice greatly appreciated!),"Hey beautiful people, 

First things first: I'm 26f, queer. When growing up I had a phase where I disliked makeup, back then it felt like all women *had* to wear makeup and I felt pressured. I didn't like wearing it, so I stopped. But my relationship to makeup since then has changed, I think of makeup as a way of expressing oneself and to pay respect to your body. I swoon whenever I see cute people with perfect winged eyeliner or an amazing sparkly highlighter. I'd like to stat anew, to begin wearing makeup again every now and then. But there's been such a long disconnect from my teenage years that I feel left behind. Whenever I try to put on makeup now, I feel like a child who's trying too hard. Also I feel fake in a way, which is really weird. Like a potato trying to be a smooth, shiny apple. It's not about applying too much, I've found a lightweight foundation that I really like and just a touch of finishing powder. There's some aspects to my face that don't really help as well, I've got the thinnest lips in the universe and a large-pored nose which starts to sweat easily. 

But I'd like to put effort into my looks again. I want to appreciate my body and accentuate what I like, but I feel so ugly when doing so. It's a weird mental blockage, I know. I've built a solid skin care routine during lockdowns which greatly helped, which makes me appreciate my skin more. I'm a social butterfly, extroverted and love to wear colourful clothing, so makeup would really really suite my style. But I can't get the hang of it. I feel dumb whenever I try. And I don't know what to do. 

I feel like I'd need a makeup queen (queen as a gender neutral term here) to compliment my efforts, to cheer me on. I can't really ask my friends to be like that for me, they've got their routines figured out and I'm too anxious to ask them, I feel silly. 

Any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. 

TL; Dr: stopped wearing makeup a long time ago, want to start anew but feel fake and dumb when doing so nowadays. Mental blockage."

So lately, I've been through a depression or depressive episode. Still trying to figure it out. Anyway.

I've been into makeup for quite a while, but I haven't really done much with it last year. I've really missed it.

I got a foundation I love from Chanel, primer from fenty and mascara from lancome. Blush from clarins. 

I need a new bronzer or something to do a little natural contour with. I don't usually use stuff with a lot of shimmer in it, but I'm up to try.

An eyeshadow palette that's for everyday use. But also with some nice blue and purple colors would be fun. Any recommendations? 

I never switch up my makeup... Help.

1687,Makeup,why doesn‚Äôt my makeup look like people on tiktok?,[removed]
1688,Makeup,"Does my face just not work with lipstick, eyeliner, and mascara? (~40yo, Kibbe Soft Classic with Soft Autumn Coloring)","I've discovered that the best makeup for me is basically: 

1. Really good skincare so I'm not broken out
2. A hint of cream blush (RMS Modest or Smile or Ilia All of Me)
3. Naturally waxed brows with a swipe of gel
4. A little bit of highlighter (RMS Living Luminizer mixed with Master Mixer), subtly at cheekbones, undereyebrows, and inner eye corners
5. On special occasions, LIGHT serum foundation (1 part Ilia Salina mixed with 2 parts Ilia Bowen) and a tiny bit of concealer (RMS 11.5) around t-zone/inner eyes/under eyes
6. Sometimes mascara works on me, sometimes it just brings out my forehead wrinkles. Switching to brown-black and taking most of it off seems to help. 
7. If I'm feeling dramatic, I can get away with exactly ONE lipstick: Spice by L'oreal‚Äîit's a deep rich brown with a hint of red and it is literally stunning on me. The same can be said for absolutely no other lipcolor I've found. 

Less seems to be more. I find most lipstick/eyeliner/eyeshadow just looks...wrong on me. It ages me. But it also makes me look like I'm 8 and trying to wear makeup. Or I can sorta-kinda pull it off but it's wearing me a bit, if you know what I mean. Like my face doesn't have the ""strength"" to carry it. It definitely screams ""I'm wearing makeup!"" and not in a good way. 

My mom was a talented makeup artist who looked great in a full face, so it's not because I'm doing it wrong...I don't think? 

I thought maybe it was wrong colors, so I extensively swatched AND photoshopped on myself and brought home a haul. Nope. It's the effect. The dark brown eyeliner for a subtle cateye matches my coloring, and I'm applying it correctly...it's just ""too much."" The first thing you see. (Wondering if I could get away with a subtler, light brown cateye? Is that a thing?) The deep red looks good with my coloring, it's just loud and jarring. Even the peach tones look old-ladyish and try-hard. 

I think it may be because I'm a soft autumn with my grey hair now (salt and pepper at 40), fair-medium skin, and dark anything or contrast anything is too much (except the lipstick is somehow okay?) 

I tried lipsticks ranging from a good brick red, to a fun plum, to a wine-shade, to a lighter glowy nude, nothing trendy, all classic. They all looked...wrong on me. Even when the color was ""right"" for a soft autumn, I still just looked better without them! They made my thin upper lip look a little thinner and aged my face. Or the subtler ones went muddy nineties warm brown on me, and it wasn't flattering. 

The only one that kinda worked was a very sheer brown, but it had a bunch of sparkles in it‚Äîwhoops. But I wonder if this is the way to go...more of a sheer brown (sans sparkles)? There was one time I owned a brown lip stain that I LOVED but of course it's discontinued now. 

While I'm mostly happy with my above routine, I would like to find a way to look a little more ""done"", or just have some fun on special occasions, esp on the lips front. What should I do? What works for my fellow soft classics, or anyone who just can't pull off regular lipstick?  

The lipstick shades I tried were all L'oreal, mostly Colour Riche. Raisin Rapture, Glowing Nude, Divine Wine, Rouge St. Germaine, Spiced Cider, Ginger Spice, Ambitious Red, Classic Wine (so bad)."

+ $5.60/gram¬† 

......

üîé REVIEW: 


üî∏Ô∏èPatchiness: no patchiness 


üî∏Ô∏èBlendability: easy to blend out 


üî∏Ô∏èFallout: experienced some fall-out, the most being from shimmer shade 'Sea Glass'. 


üî∏Ô∏èShade Variance: this palette doesn't have the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I look for. Each shade included is a midtone or lighter, it is lacking any true depth capacity. There are a few traditional neutral transition shades included in this particular color-story, &amp; they may work for a variety of skintones. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 4:6 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 40% / 60% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. There is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. There were no 'dud' shades in this palette. 


üî∏Ô∏èFormula: 


MATTES: I liked the actual formula of these mattes well enough, but there wasn't really any true depth difference between them. It was difficult to use this palette in the way that I like to wear eyeshadow due to its limited color range. Each matte blended out nicely &amp; built well upon itself. I find this to be a more 'buildable' formula as opposed to extremely pigmented straight away. 


SHIMMERS: I enjoyed using these shades. I really liked that even if you over-blended them, they were resistant to lose their intensity. Some of the shimmers are incredibly smooth &amp; one-noted, &amp; others had quite a bit of microglitters that created a gigantic mess (although they DID look pretty on the eye). 


FOILED METALLICS: of course, this would be my FAVORITE formula within this whole palette. Sadly, there are only two of these shades - but they are sure fun to play with. Both shades are somewhat flaky upon touch, but present as extremely shiny shades that can be used in a multitude of ways. They even picked up perfectly on a dry brush. 

......

üî∏Ô∏èPackaging: the packaging isn't necessarily reminiscent of the interior color-story, but it is a good overall representation of the brand &amp; who they are as a company. I think it works.

......

üî∏Ô∏èRecommendation: Again - I had to wipe off my original looks several times. THIS is not my type of palette, it wasn't created for someone like me. I attempted to do one of my most-favorite looks with it - &amp; I could NOT get it to perform for my style of makeup. I sat back &amp; pondered. THIS palette was created for the person-on-the-go; somebody who wants to achieve a quick look with minimal effort. A shiny shade on the lid &amp; something matte in the crease. If that is your style, you will really enjoy this. I'll tell you that you cannot get a gradient with this, &amp; the included shades aren't the best for layering. It's made for a totally different consumer than me, &amp; I can recognize &amp; appreciate that. If you like simplicity, this gives you plenty of options. 


The price per shade is 'meh'. This is definitely a higher-end palette, &amp; the price reflects that. Each shadow pan holds below an average amount of shadow. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette.

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èIf you are interested in this palette, I have a neutral opinion on it (due to it not being my style):

+ no gradients, no layering of shades

+ very easy to blend

+ gives you options for simple looks

......

+ Favorite Shade: Flourish

- Least Favorite Shade: Sunkissed

......

üö¶ Rating: C

......

‚≠ê RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

......

OTHER EYE MAKEUP:

+ Item Beauty - Brow Chow Ultra-Fine Brow Definer Pencil (medium brown) 

+ Wunder2 Cosmetics - WunderBrow Brow Gel (black/brown) 

+ Brow Bar by Reema - Brow Gel (clear) 

+ Revlon - Photoready Candid Antioxidant Concealer (020 bisque)

+ Langmanni - Gel Eyeliner (12 black)

I'm a guy who doesn't wear heavy makeup though, just enough to hide blemishes, and wearing a full layer of foundation isn't really my thing, and since the shade is too light for me to contour with, is there any purpose of me keeping it? Is there another way I can make use of it?

If not what are some good products to contour with?"

My skin type is combo, very oily in my nose and my chin and kind of in my forehead. I don't have any marks or spots, although I do have vitiligo in one eye ‚Äì that's a tough one to cover. 

I've heard very good things about these two foundations, but I'm not sure which one to buy. I like a natural-looking finish. I hate that cakey, powdery look on the skin. I don't want to look like a dusty piece of furniture. ü§£

Can you help me out?

Thanks a lot,

1712,Makeup,Natural looking strip lashes with a thin/invisible band?,"I used to get lash extensions religiously but  I got a bit sick of the maintenance and cost, especially now that I work from home. I also wanted to experimemt with lash styles a bit more.

1713,Makeup,Should I stop using this foundation I used once because it‚Äôs causing my recent breakouts?,"Context: I am diagnosed with rosacea, meaning when triggered, my cheeks and nose flare up. Other than that I rarely get acne. 

However when I used Revlon Colorstay foundation, breakouts started to happen on the side of my face and my chin. I do consider the fact that there may be other factors other than the foundation that may have caused it. However, as a precaution, should I stop using it?

Edit: I just got boosted before the weekend + I take BCP too but it never caused me to breakout before."

All the shimmer shadows suck you barely get any payoff and everything else is mediocre. 

Trust me I‚Äôve bought ALOT of their products to know and it‚Äôs just not that good. 

But it‚Äôs cheap sooo I guess I get it but I do get sick of seeing it promoted so much when most of it is hot garbage."
1718,Makeup,Replacement for Nyx's discontinued Bare With Me tinted skin serum?,So Nyx has discontinued my favorite line of theirs. Does anyone have an suggestions for a replacement for when I finally run out? I'm really just looking for something that evens my skin tone.
1719,Makeup,Nars vs Luminous silk,I am shade Oslo in Nars radiant Longwear‚Ä¶ what is the closest shade match in Armani luminous silk??
1720,Makeup,"Medium coverage foundation for textured, oily skin?","I‚Äôve tried so many foundations and I can‚Äôt seem to find the one yet. I don‚Äôt want something super heavy as I find that it makes my skin look cakey very quickly, I like a slightly more natural look but I do have some light acne scars that I‚Äôd like to cover. My skin gets oily around my T zone but I still have dry patches that foundations tend to cling to. 


What I‚Äôve tried already:
Fenty pro filt‚Äôr- too heavy and clung to dry spots

Tarte amazonian clay- too heavy and it separated all over my skin

Too faced born this way- made my skin so greasy within the first few hours

Too faced peach perfect- loved, maybe slightly on the heavier side but unfortunately discontinued

Tarte hydroflex serum foundation- probably the closest thing to my HG but I hate the packaging and the consistency is so water-like that it gets messy.


All recommendations are super appreciated! Thank you!"
1721,Makeup,Affordable eyelash curlers and mascara?,"hi, your fellow broke student here lol. i wanted to ask for suggestions on eyelash curlers that actually do curl my lashes properly and for a long time (im personally not a fan of fake eyelashes), and a mascara that isnt crusty and adds volume, but for both of them to be quite affordable. any help is appreciated, thanks x"

I am worried that they will just fall off or start peeling off, and won‚Äôt survive. Will they?? What should i do if not? I usually just do mascara, but my eyelashes are so uneven. I don‚Äôt care that they aren‚Äôt super long, but if I could fix their unevenness, i wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about fake lashes. Anyone know what to do about that? if not, how about the fake lashes??"
1724,Makeup,How do I curl my eyelashes without a curler?,Not sure if this has been asked before- I have used the revlon and elf eyelash curlers before and they always worked but I started using oil on my lashes so they're much thicker and longer now and my eyelashes just won't curl. I wanted to cut back using it anyways because theyre kind of harsh on the eyelashes so I figured I should find a new way to curl them. Any ideas? Or maybe products to make it curly? Idk

1729,Makeup,Isle of Paradise self tanning drops or spray?,"What it comes down to is that I read a lot about this being an affordable, really good self tanner and from a tester I've got from a different brand, I have to say I love it because it makes my makeup routine shorter. I want to buy one from Isle of Paradise but I'm wondering if there's any difference in terms of the drops and the spray in terms of effectiveness? I am planning to just add a little bit to my daily moisturiser because I've noticed that it's much easier to get a gradual tan from it and any ""mistakes"" won't be as immediately noticeable as pure application. So in that sense, would there really be a difference if I added a drop or two from the drops to my moisturiser or a spray? The reason I'm asking is that the spray is way cheaper and if it basically works the same if mixed with moisturiser, then I'll definitely go for that one. 

Would appreciate it if anyone could offer any insight."

1742,Makeup,Morphe Filter Effect &amp; Flashback,"Hello, this is my first post here, so I apologize if I'm all over the place. I'm just now getting into makeup in college (strict parents) and have no idea what I'm doing. The first foundation I tried was too dark so I went to Ulta to find a second one. I ended up leaving with the [Morphe Filter Effect Rich 25](https://www.morphe.com/products/filter-effect-soft-focus-foundation-filter-rich-25). The employee who helped me said that my undertones are more golden, but this shade blends out pretty well. The only issue I have with it is flashback. 

After digging around on the sub for a bit, I found that flashback can be caused by silica, SPF, or an incorrect undertone match. My current moisturizer is the [Cetaphil Oil Absorbing Moisturizer](https://www.cetaphil.com/us/moisturizers/dermacontrol-oil-absorbing-moisturizer-spf-30/302994313044.html) which has SPF. This is more than likely the culprit, but I was a bit unsure because I applied my moisturizer in the morning and the foundation in the evening. 

Is there anything else I can do to combat flashback other than removing the moisturizer? Some friends suggested color corrector or setting powder, but I wasn't sure if this would remedy the issue. 

Thanks!"

His dog was really excited to see us when we came and, long story short, accidents happened and it fell on my foot. I‚Äôm pretty sore and swollen.

1761,Makeup,"Glitter eyeshadow, can't get it off??","My daughter (6) got some makeup from her grandmother for Christmas, she b e g g e d me to let her put some on for Christmas day, so I did. I didn't have a mom growing up so I have no idea how makeup works other than lipstick goes on the lips, eyeshadow goes on the eyes, etc. 

She picked this glittery green color to go with her dress and I just slapped some on her eyelid and called it a day, I don't really know how to do any cool stuff so I just put it all over. Then came time to take it off. I used some baby soap and a cotton pad and swiped her eyes over and over and over, until she was stomping her feet and begging me to stop. Still glittery. So I told her we should take a shower and she hops in and has a grand old time, face all dripping wet so I'm sure her eyes got rinsed, and just to be sure I swipe it some more with the cotton pads again and again and again until the water runs cold. Still glittery?? *Most* of the glitter has gone, except all the flecks around and on her eyelashes. 

So, I look online to figure out if there's a better way to get the last bits off, and apparently you're not even supposed to use glitter near your eyes because it can get in your eyes and scratch up your corneas and make you go blind? Why would they make eyeshadow like that?? Now im wondering what the hell I'm supposed to do, I don't want to let her go to bed like this because what if it gets in her eyes in her sleep, but she's had me wipe her eyes down for close to an hour now and I'm not even sure it's helping anymore?? 

Tl;dr, I put glitter eyeshadow on my daughter's eye and now it won't come off, any tips?? I heard oil based remover would work but I don't have that, I have like vegetable oil....?"

My foundation ALWAYS separates only on my nose. I used bare minerals prime time for so long with tarte shape tape pressed powder. I love the pressed powder because it looks SO good on the rest of my face, it‚Äôs just my nose that‚Äôs the issue. So I read some posts about the primer not being ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù so I bought tarte primer so it would be compatible. Same issue, makeup is separating on my nose after less than an hour. I use cerave moisturize and wait for it to sink in before I prime, then let that sink in before I use foundation. I have combination skin.

Has anyone come up with any other solutions?  Possibly a foundation/primer combo that works for you? I‚Äôm desperate."
1764,Makeup,Is James Charles's palette worth it at half price?,"I'm doing my sister's makeup for her prom.

I only do casual makeup on myself for special occasions but I've gotten okay at it. However, I've only ever needed cheap makeup to achieve some pretty minimal looks. Both my eyeshadow palettes are drugstore palettes and super sheer (I've got a Revlon and a Maybelline palette) and you can't get any kind of an intense look with them like you'd need for prom. I'd love to get Colourpop but shipping is pretty expensive to Australia. James Charles's palette is going for half price now at 30 AUD plus 7 shipping (so approx 27 USD total). Is it worth it at that price? Otherwise, are there any other quality palettes you would recommend to use for a prom, + add to a pretty bare-bones makeup collection?

Everything online about it suggests it's great for dry skin (I'm not overly dry but this clings to places I've never had an issue with, with other concealers)

My routine consists of a good moisturiser, primer, estee lauder double wear (this stuff is fantastic and doesn't cling to dry skin) when it comes to concealer the Nars just doesn't agree with my foundation/skin. I've tried elf and found it too dry.

I've included two photos of me without make-up, and one where I'm wearing pretty much the only style I've found looks flattering, but I'm still not sold on it. It emphasizes the outer edge of my lid in a v-shape and has a very smoked-out undereye. Sorry the last photo is kind of dark!

If you can think of any celebs or make up artists that have a similar eyeshape to me, please share!! I would love to have someone who I can stalk for make-up inspiration.

within an hour of wearing any mascara, it ends up transferring on top on my concealer on my under eyes. this does not happen when i go without the concealer. 

What are your concealer recommendations that won‚Äôt mess with your mascara? Thanks !"

1805,Makeup,What do you think the future is for makeup in upscale department stores?,"I‚Äôm talking about places like Nordstorm, Macy‚Äôs, Dillards, Neimans. Curious about other‚Äôs opinions. With Sephora putting new stores inside of Kohls, ulta partnering with target on top of already having so many free standing stores; what will happen to the high end makeup counters in the future? I truly don‚Äôt see them lasting much longer. As someone who recently left a makeup counter job after 5 years, it was a huge struggle. We just couldn‚Äôt compete with the insanely good reward point systems, online discounts, and free gifts everyone else was handing out. We‚Äôd get yelled at for not selling enough like it was out faults. People avoided the beauty counters at all costs, and I don‚Äôt blame them. I worked with some pretty outgoing sharks who wouldn‚Äôt let you leave without spending money on stuff you don‚Äôt want. It does make me a bit sad when my nostalgia brings me back to my early teens when my mom would let me get a makeover at a bobbi brown counter and I felt so fancy and special. However there is no incentive for anyone to shop there unless you want that experience or are an older lady who has been shopping there already and doesn‚Äôt want to change their ways. I don‚Äôt see any comeback for the beauty counters, and at most department stores they rely on makeup counter sales for at least 10% of their total sales. But it‚Äôs not just makeup, I don‚Äôt think many people enjoy shopping at these stores anymore. I wonder what will happen in the future, if this will lead to department stores closing as a whole or just taking out their beauty sections."

So, my question is, what is face primer used for and would I benefit from using it?

Another thing, I've noticed that if I layer lotion, face powder, and then blush/bronze/contour in powder form it tends to get very tacky by some bits of ex blush sticking to the lotion. So I tend to only get lotion where my concealer goes. But if I had face primer all over my face and powder on top, could I layer blush on that without that issue?"

The good thing is that companies in the cosmetics industry are beginning to take big steps toward sustainable skincare and reusable packaging. Many are now opting to formulate ingredients that promote sustainability, such as refillable makeup products.

Without any eyeshadow this isn't a huge deal, because you can't really see it, but anytime I've tried eyeshadow it REALLY brings out the wrinkles and looks like hell. I've watched a bunch of YT tutorials that say they're for eyeshadow on loose or crepe-y eyelids, but none of them have worked for me. Do you have any suggestions as to how to fix/work around this?

So far I've been using Milani primer, cheapo brushes (two different kinds), and the Wet &amp; Wild Color Icon and Rimmel Magnif'eyes Electric Violet palettes. Forgot to mention, I'm 41.

- I‚Äôm having trouble deciding what, if anything, to do with my lips??? I‚Äôm hesitant to do anything that accentuates them because of how thin and small my mouth is. In my inexperienced mind, that means a small amount of gloss or stain or something?

With how controversial Jeffree is, I feel a bit weird using his product. Is this weird or an understandable thing? What would you do if you were in my shoes? I'm around halfway through the pan and I want to be done with it already but the hefty price tag is making me want to use it all up since I'm only 20 and don't make that much money. This will probably be my last Jeffree Star product because honestly, some of my highlighters from the drugstore is way better and most of them are under ¬£10."

1972,Makeup,Dye Eyebrow,"Hi, guy here. I have some half-normal eyebrows, except for the fact I have a few hairs on each that are like ... a few miles away from the rest. I heard that attempting to cut or trim your eyebrows is a recipe for having them grow back 10 times as much and including curly and what not (slightly irrelevant but a bit like this: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32233570](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32233570)). So I wondered if I could just lessen the effect of them/make them fainter. A bit like hair on the arms that's there but not really visible.

üìå Physician's Formula - Butter Believe It! Foundation + Concealer 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I did a full 12-hour wear-test on this, &amp; it far surpassed my expectations. This foundation DOESN'T budge. It stays in place all day long, looks flawless, &amp; applies well with any application method of your choosing. This has been my all-year 'hero' foundation, easily beating even high-end competitors. Where I live is hot, humid, &amp; yuck - &amp; this foundation wears great for longer outdoor time periods where you may experience some sweating. It didn't break up on me after physical activity. 


üï∂ Shade: Light-to-Medium

üí∞ Price: $11.77 ‚Ä¢ (Amazon)

üìå Kiko Milano - Green Me Brow Pencil 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I've been raving about this all year long! It's my top favorite brow pencil in my current collection. Although it's a 'sharpenable' style pencil, the formula is superb &amp; the color is spot-on. If I keep it sharpened, I can achieve crisp-looking lines &amp; a fully-blended color. It's so very smooth, not waxy, &amp; perfectly pigmented. It comes complete with attached spoolie. 


üï∂ Shade: 101

üìå ABH/Norvina Cosmetics - Eyeshadow Palette Formula 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: My God, I don't think I've ever been so in love with an eyeshadow formula! Granted, I haven't tried EVERY single palette, but the ones that I have tried were simply amazing, &amp; had me coming back for more. Albeit an extremely pigmented formula, it blends out with perfection - making difficult gradients a thing of the past. With all of the neat, unique color-stories, you are bound to just get creative &amp; create some really incredible looks. The metallics are beautiful, the light colors don't blend away, &amp; it wears spectacularly over the course of the day.

üìå L'Or√©al - Infallible Long Wear Eye Pencil 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I know this is such a simple (&amp; slightly boring) product to give an award to, but damn - have I had trouble finding a solid, reliable black eyeliner! The first time I used this, I loved the slick, gel formula. After wearing it multiple times between my upper lashes, I found it to never, ever transfer to the surrounding areas. It never gooped in the corners. This eyeliner stays in place! It wears especially well - lasting me all day long, &amp; even being slightly resistant to removal at the end of a long day! It does come off (without scrubbing) with an oil-based remover. This has been my ride-or-die black eyeliner this year, &amp; I'm so glad I came across it.

üìå Essence Cosmetics - Lipsticks 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I'm not opposed to dropping some money on a good lipstick, but WHY do that when Essence only asks a tiny fraction of the price for an outstanding product? I've put these lipsticks through some extreme wear, &amp; they last better than Pat McGrath, equivalent to Charlotte Tilbury. For $1.99. The colors in their 'This is Nude' line are so beautiful, the wear-time is seriously on-point, &amp; the formula itself ... it FEELS so high-end. It is an absolute pleasure to use these lipsticks, &amp; I love the duality of wearing a great lipstick that is an ACTUAL value product.

üìå HealFast - Beauty Supplement 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I know not everyone is a 'supplement person', but for those of you who are - this is a must-have beauty supplement. I've been taking this one for the last few months, &amp; the changes it's made are undeniable. A lot of beauty supplements 'claim' to do things (&amp; I've tried &amp; tested them with little to no results), but THIS one is giving me the hair/skin/nails results that I have been searching for, for YEARS. It was formulated by actual physicians (which is a great keypoint for me when I look for something like this). I buy a bottle each time I'm halfway through my current one so I don't ever run out. The label says to take 5 capsules daily, but I only dose 2 capsules at nighttime, &amp; have STILL seen mega results. If you have been looking for something that actually works, this is IT!

With all this said, I have had a Sephora gift card burning a hole in my wallet for almost 6 months, and I'm sure I'll be receiving another one for Christmas. I don't even know wtf to get at Sephora anymore, so what are your favorite finds or recommendations?

I've only ever tried out a few different mascaras before, but I have never tried any of Revolution's. However, I am in love with this mascara, the formula is just right, not too sticky, easily buildable, and the wand separates my eyelashes beautifully. I really want to use this for every day use but I think it was a limited edition mascara as I haven't seen it in stores or the website since? so I've been limiting my usage. I am wondering if anyone has tried this mascara and knows any alternatives or dupes that are similar, or if anyone knows if Revolution's other mascaras are just as good?

2006,Makeup,How can I stop cakey foundation?," 

## How To Make Your Foundation Not Look Cakey And Ways To Fix It

&amp;#x200B;

* **Skin Care Routine**

A fundamental step to avoid cakey makeup is to follow a proper skin care routine. Use a good exfoliator, moisturizer, face oil, and face serum. Try to use chemical exfoliators as they do not have any harsh microbeads. Go for exfoliators with ingredients like AHAs and BHAs that remove all the dead skin cells and make your skin soft and healthy. Do not forget to moisturize your face at least twice a day. Before going to bed, use a face serum as it provides excellent nourishment to your skin. Look for a face serum that contains hyaluronic acid to bind the water molecules into the skin.

&amp;#x200B;

* **How To Prep Your Skin Before Applying Foundation**

Your skin needs a proper prep routine before you start applying [foundation](https://www.premierebeaute.com/collections/make-up/products/liquid-foundation). If you have dry skin, your foundation can settle on the dry patches and cling to your face. Thus, it is crucial that you start by applying a primer. Primer opens evens out your skin texture and creates a smooth base for your foundation.

Ensure that you apply a lightweight moisturizer, a face serum, or a facial oil at least 10 minutes before applying a primer. While applying primer, focus on the areas around your nose and the high ends of your face."

2009,Makeup,LASH PARADISE dupe help NEEDED,"Okayyyy, so I found the L'Or√©al Lash Paradise mascara a couple of years ago, and it's been my hg ever since. It is sooo good and does everything I want it to; gives me lots of volume, extreme length, doesn't clump and separates my lashes and keeps it like that, no matter how many layers I put on. Recently I've been trying to go cruelty free with all my makeup products, and preferably vegan too, but I have no idea what mascara can replace my LP, and I was wondering if anyone knows of any dupes?
I researched a bit last night and came up with these:

Too Faced - Better Than Sex (I know the LP is supposed to be the dupe for this, but I've heard it smudges like crazy?)

Tarte - Lights Camera Lashes

KVD - Go Big or Go Home

Milk Makeup - Kush

NYX - On The Rise Volume Liftscara

ELF - Volumizing &amp; Defining Mascara

My lashes neeeeed a dry formula, and Ihave nooooo idea which one is the best? Or some other mascara for that matter. I was gonna add on the Urban Decay Perversion, but saw that it had Marine Collagen in it:/ I also live in Europe so I don't really have that many options unless I wanna pay a crazy amount in import charges and stuffüòÖ

My best friend larps. The makeup she wears for it is typically greens, blues, and teals. 

I had lunch with her today, and she said she used to have a blue liquid lip that she LOVED but it might be discontinued. I think it was either a Superstay liquid lip or a Liquid Catsuit. 

Anyways, I want to find her a dark blue (maybe teal) liquid lip that she can wear for her LARP character. Christmas is coming up; she prefer gifts that have some utility to them and I thought it would be nice to surprise her with a new lipstick. She said she prefers a matte finish because she moves around a lot and her lip color tends to smear, not to mention she's an avid coffee drinker. 

My budget is $20 max, I'm trying to look at Black Friday deals atm, but I really just need recommendations in general.

üéØ REVIEW: 


PACKAGING: I've ordered many-a-lash-serum before, but never received one in its own reusable storage pouch! I think that was a cute touch. The actual lash serum tube is pretty basic - I do wish it had a few details printed onto the actual tube. 

...............

INGREDIENT THOUGHTS: there are four main, actives in this formulation, &amp; I wanted to look at each one, &amp; how it's supposed to affect hair growth: 


+ Rose Water - yes; the¬†vitamins A, B3, C and E¬†of rose water promote the growth of your hair, by nourishment and promoting hair growth. 


+ Polypeptide Blend - yes; Oligopeptide-2, which is also known as¬†insulin-like growth factor-1 or IGF-1, may be of benefit to your hair. Copper peptides not only play a significant role in regenerating new hair growth, but they can also make your existing hair look and feel thicker by increasing the follicle size. 


+ Hyaluronic Acid - yes; hyaluronic acid helps by¬†improving blood flow to¬†the scalp, encouraging hair growth. 


+ Aloe Vera Leaf Extract - yes; Aloe vera promotes healthy hair growth thanks to a special enzyme found in aloe called proteolytic enzymes.

...............

LASH SERUM SPECIFICS: 


+ FRAGRANCE: none 


+ FREQUENCY OF USE: every single night before bed 


+ EASE OF APPLICATION: very easy; apply a thin line across top of lashline 


+ APPLICATOR: a very thin, pointed brush which was quite flexible 


+ BURNING/STINGING: none 


+ EYE COLOR CHANGES: this formula does NOT contain any prostaglandin, which is the hormone that's responsible for eye color changes. 

...............

PRODUCT DEFECTS/FAILS: every night that I used this, the applicator brush couldn't maintain the amount of product, &amp; it would ball-up on the tip, creating a large pool of serum on my eyelid. I sometimes had to wipe the brush off (wasting expensive serum) to prevent this. 

...............

LOVES: I love the aesthetics of this entire brand - I'm naturally attracted to their products, &amp; want to learn more. I love that in-depth research went into this formula, making a lash serum more useable for a larger amount of people. I love the size of the tube - it's not extremely oversized, it's manageable &amp; comfortable to hold in the hand.

...............

RESULTS: I used this lash serum routinely, every single night before I went to bed. I began using it on August 15, 2021. Today is November 25, 2021 - &amp; it's well past the 6-week-results' timeframe. My actual lash growth results are not what I expected. I can definitely tell that they slighty grew (both in length &amp; density), but not anywhere near the results I've gotten from competing lash serums. 

...............

‚ñ™Ô∏èDexterity: no concerns

......

üåü RATING: B

......

‚≠ê RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

......

üòé FINAL REFLECTIONS: 


‚ñ™Ô∏èAlthough not completely WOW'd by my results, I can definitely appreciate this serum. It fills a void in the marketplace by making a niche product more universal. I never slacked off using this, &amp; I just expected a lot more from it. I think after dissecting exactly WHAT this is, I think it's just 'too natural' of a formula for me, personally. When I put so much dedication into something, I want to see actual, life-changing results.

## Skin Undertone Tips

There are a few tips when it comes to answering, ‚ÄúWhat is my skin undertone?‚Äù 

**Look at your wrist veins under natural light.**¬†

‚Ä¢ If your veins appear to be green, you probably have warm undertones.

‚Ä¢ If they‚Äôre blue or purple, you probably have cool undertones.

‚Ä¢ If they are a mix of both, you may have neutral undertones.¬†

**Put on a piece of gold jewelry and a piece of silver jewelry. Which looks better?**

‚Ä¢ If gold looks more flattering, you‚Äôre probably warm.¬†

‚Ä¢ If silver looks better, you‚Äôre probably cool.

‚Ä¢ If both look equally good, you‚Äôre neutral.¬†

**Put on a plain white T.** **Now go outside.**

‚Ä¢ If your face looks yellow-ish or you know you‚Äôd look better in an off-white or beige color, you‚Äôre warm.

2039,Makeup,What mirror magnification do I use for bad vision? 2x or 5x?," Hi everyone. Yes, I know the best way to find out is by testing mirrors in-person! Well unfortunately I have been quarantining since I tested positive for COVID 5 days ago (I'm okay!).

Since there's deals going on right now I want to buy one!! I am farsighted with -5.00 loss of vision in each eye. My face has to be right in front of a normal mirror to see what I'm doing. Oh the neckaches..

I'm probably going to have to buy one with 3 options built in - normal one to see myself with glasses, magnified one to apply makeup without glasses (most important), and then a larger magnified one for eye makeup.

Any help? Thank you :)

\- oh and, my eyes hate contacts so those are not an option :)"

Also, I don't have those great vertical lines at the start of the eyebrow (by the nose) - a beautician once asked me if I had a unibrow. Is there anything I can do to get those back?

2051,Makeup,Help with makeup for a guy with too blonde eyebrows,"So I'm blonde and white, blonde to a degree that my skin color almost match my hair color.

I've always admired my own appearance and got a lot of confidence regarding me, to a fair extent. But most of it is almost based in very low-ish lightning when I can have my eyebrows pronounced more.

I love the shape of my eyebrows and would like to see if theres anything ""subtle"" I can use to show the more. While I do understand that many nowadays stand for men using makeup, many still don't, and even if you do, you could still regard it as weird to some extent, all based from social circles in my life.

Just because of that social ""norm"", I'd like to ask people with more knowledge on makeup, is there any way I can use makeup for my eyebrows in a way that wont make it too obvious?

Seeing myself beautiful to my own regard is something that has brought me a lot of confidence in my more recent years entering my late teen, and sure, you could tell me just to think every flaw about myself is beautiful aswell but that can be hard for some people, so I'd again just want to check my chances on what makeup could possibly provide me.

Thank you for the advice in advance!"

2053,Makeup,Under Eye Concealer Recommendations,"Hoping someone could recommend me a good under eye concealer. I have purple and blue bags under my eyes. It's genetic so no amount of sleep or creams are going to get rid of them. I have very pale skin, purple bags, and cool undertones so stuff that would generally neutralize purple like a yellow end up looking too warm/brown/yellow/not natural. My skin is normally pretty dry if that matters. I've also been using Becca's under eye brightening cream and that seems to do an okay job, but would like something with a bit more coverage. I also don't generally wear any foundation just bc my skin is nice enough that I don't really need it and honestly don't like to cover up my freckles :). Can anyone recommend a concealer for me?"
2054,Makeup,Light coverage foundation recs?,"I've tried fresh wear &amp; the shade 410 is perfect but it can be finicky with my dry patches, the wet in wild tint looks beautiful but it rubs off *so* easily. I'm looking for a light coverage foundation that can handle long wear and masks. I'm fair and neutral, have deep smile lines and normal/dry skin so hopefully something with a dewy/natural finish.

2056,Makeup,How to get over the fear of being/looking absolutely terrible at makeup?,"I have eyeshadow palettes, lipsticks, foundations and such that I've always \*wanted to and meant to learn how to apply. But I'm always so deathly afraid of looking like a clown regardless of how many YT tutorials I look at, so I end up just curling my lashes, throwing on some mascara, and doing my brows. 

This has been going on for years.. I'm now in a professional line of work where I can't look like I just walked out of a circus. I get it.. no one's great at applying makeup right off the bat, but how do I get over this learning curve w/o embarrassing myself in the workplace? 

My friends aren't really makeup fiends themselves, so I can't really turn to them for advice, and I don't trust myself to have a good eye. I can appreciate beautiful makeup on others, but couldn't imagine reproducing it on myself."
2057,Makeup,Eyebrow not growing,"I don't know why but for forever as a child till now I've noticed that the inner part of my right eyebrow has never grown in, compared to my left one, so it literally looks like part of my eyebrow is missing and just looks silly. I really don't know why it's like this because it does not seem normal at all, I've heard castor oil can maybe help but I'm not sure if you can even grow hair where it's never even grown before?"
2058,Makeup,Green base and Pore Primer,"Hey folks. I always use a green tinted base to even out red patches. I‚Äôd like to try a pore primer as well but do I use it before or after the green tint?

I looked through many different types but I couldn‚Äôt find any similar to mine. The best way I can explain my eye shape is like a mix between monolid and almond. I‚Äôm part Chinese so I decided to look into East Asian eye shapes and finally found the phoenix eye. It‚Äôs the one that resembles my eyes the best but apparently it‚Äôs not a very common shape. So I‚Äôm having a hard time finding good eye makeup tips. If there‚Äôs anyone who‚Äôs familiar with East Asian makeup/phoenix eyes, that would be greatly appreciated!

2072,Makeup,Charlotte Tilbury Is it worth the hype update,"So Im not sure if any of you saw it but a few days ago I created a post and asked if CT was worth the hype because I was interested in the brand just iffy on the price of it. 

I ended up getting three things to test the brand out and here were my thoughts.

The airbrush powder: I really did like it no complaints it is a good powder. The formula though I know I can find at least 2 cheaper dupes for. 

The cheat lip liner in iconic nude: Probably my favorite formula for a lip liner ever and the shade is super flattering! Honestly my favorite thing out of everything I got from CT.

Pillow Talk matte lipstick: A little disappointed in the formula. I feel like Pillowtalk is the main staple of the brand so wanted to try it out. the formula definitely settled into every fine line on my lips. I feel like MAC lipsticks are cheaper and very similar but better in terms of performance."

2075,Makeup,Palette Review &amp; Pictorial - Sample Beauty: The Equalizer Palette Volume I,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]


‚úÖ New Saturday Palette Pictorial &amp; Review

......

‚û°Ô∏è NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the palette quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 


üåü Also, this is my first time deep diving into this palette, &amp; are my true impressions. As I continue to use it in more ways, I will update you as to how my thoughts on its performance change/develop.

......

üîé REVIEW: 


üî∏Ô∏èPatchiness: no patchiness 


üî∏Ô∏èBlendability: easy to blend out 


üî∏Ô∏èFallout: experienced some fallout, the most being from shimmer shade 'tonic' 


üî∏Ô∏èShade Variance: this palette has a very nice 'light-to-dark' gradient. There are a few neutral transition shades, which may work for a broad range of skintones. The formula balance ratio in this palette is 13:15 (mattes to shimmers), &amp; I'm happy with a 43%/50% formula split; I think it provides enough balance. There is a matte black in this palette, which I always like - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. I didn't run into any duds with this palette. 


üî∏Ô∏èFormula: 


MATTES: the matte formula is what makes Sample Beauty really stand out. They are just simply good mattes. They easily work in your favor, not having to coerce them to function well. They blend, build, &amp; layer nicely. I also enjoy the nice range of blending mattes provided in this palette, so it's easy to create gradients. 


SHIMMERS: the shimmers are just basic. I didn't run into any that blew my mind, but none were awful. They just looked and performed like you would expect a standard shimmer to behave. I really like that a shimmer is provided to match each matte, so the looks created can be monochromatic. 


SEQUINS: there are only two of these in this palette, &amp; they are easily identifiable. They both have a completely matte base, but also have pinpoint reflects blended in - making it a bit more interesting. These shades can be used in the same way as a normal matte shadow, as the sparkly reflects don't really stay in place, &amp; kind of just fall away as you blend them. 


MATTE BLACK: this is a good one; having both the depth &amp; saturation I look for. It's very true-to-color, &amp; an excellent addition to this color-story.

......

üî∏Ô∏èPackaging: pretty boring; I don't think the exterior packaging really matches the contents of the actual palette. 

......

üî∏Ô∏èRecommendation: This is one of those palettes where there are SO many looks to be created, that it's almost overwhelming to know where to start. It has every primary color, plus some great blending shades. Not all rainbow palettes are well-done, but this one definitely is! Also, I wanted to point out that this is the CHEAPEST palette (by shade &amp; per gram) that I've ever reviewed! I can't believe what a great deal it is! The price per shade is 'excellent' when compared to market price. Each shadow pan holds an above-average amount of shadow. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. 


‚ñ™Ô∏èIf you are interested in this palette, I would definitely recommend it for 3 reasons: 

+ very easy to work with

+ endless amount of creative possibilities 

+ very large color-story in minimal space 

......

+ Favorite Shade: Eve

- Least Favorite Shade: Base

......

üö¶ Rating: A

......

‚≠ê RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

......

Recently I have started to do my own makeup. Right now I am more focused on the face and not so much on the eyes. I obviously don‚Äôt have that much experience so I think this is were the first issue starts. Okay so I watch a bunch of MUA videos and videos on them doing clients makeup. I notice that the face will look professionally done and when I do my own makeup it looks like I don‚Äôt even have makeup on. 

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I know some love natural makeup but at times I want the dramatic look. I‚Äôm pretty light/pale skinned so I can‚Äôt really go ham on the contour/bronzer lol. Not sure if that‚Äôs the issue because I would love to also have a much more bronzed face without it looking too harsh.

 I know I probably don‚Äôt make any sense but I would love for my makeup to look I guess very noticeable. How do I achieve that? I have oily skin but I sort of hate matte foundations and love the shinny look too."

2211,Makeup,Need help with a choice for my partner,"  

Hi Makeup reddit! 

My partner always tells me about make-up and asked me so many times about advent calendar I want to pick one for her. I know make-up semi well, but I help with the following problem:  
 The problem is I am stuck between 2 calendars. She is already a make-up fan. We have things ranging from Morphe, Two faced and Urban decay. (smashbox,naked,revolution) 

Now I have found 2 calendars I think match her vibe the most, but I am stuck... I need a second (and more) opinion.... 

The choice is between:   
 **Makeup Revolution The Ultimate Glamour Collection 12 Day Advent Calendar**   
 and   
 **Makeup Revolution x Friends 12 Days Of Christmas Advent Calendar** 

The problem is she is not a Friends fan, she loves shimmers and I am wondering if any of you have experience what swatches the best, good pigmentation and more! Any advice will be appreciated"

I've always had long lashes and narrow eyes, but for the past couple of years I've been on eye drops with the side effect of making eyes darker, deeper set, and eyelash growth (when the optometrist told me that he then paused, looked at me, and added 'not that anyone would be able to tell the difference with you').  By this point my lashes have certainly gotten longer, and I have two issues.

1) they clump together a lot.  I think some is the drops leaking out of my eyes onto them, maybe some is just natural stickiness?  I try rinsing them off when I'm washing my face but that just reduces the clumping some.  Any suggestions on the best way to fight clumping?

2) They are kind of uneven, like the outer half of the top droops over my eye like a curtain often, but the inner part is more up, the lengths are not even, and they just look sort of unkempt.  Is there such thing as eyelash trimming?  Or combing?  Or something I should be doing to keep these at least looking respectable (and maybe less noticeable)?"

üëâ Milani - Conceal + Perfect Smooth Finish Cream-to-Powder Foundation 


First-Impression Review: This is a foundation BALM, akin to the infamous KVD Vegan Beauty 'Good Apple' foundation. Right away, I found it difficult to get a good shade match, because you can't readily add any mixers into a balm. This is a silicone-based foundation, with 'dimethicone' being the first listed ingredient. To this, I anticipated a very smooth, pore-filling type of look. There is no fragrance to this formula, &amp; it is housed in a cute compact. To the touch, the texture feels very smooth, &amp; almost resistant. The consistency is very slippery, &amp; you can feel the transformation of cream-to-powder on your fingertips. Upon use, I found this to result in a 'skin perfecting' look. I applied it with a dense foundation brush, &amp; ended up with a natural, satin finish. This foundation is not self-setting, &amp; definitely feels like it needs to be set in place. It looks slightly heavy as I look close-up, &amp; I achieved a medium coverage level. However, you can get full-coverage if you continually build it up. I think normal/oily/combo skin types would most benefit from this.

üëâ Covergirl - Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer 


First-Impression Review: I've had my eye on this concealer since it's launch, &amp; I'm very excited to test it out today. This is supposed to be a 'hydrating' concealer with a totally vegan composition. I found it to have a very subtle 'makeup-like' scent to it. The concealer is housed in a tube with a small doefoot applicator. The texture of the formula is very soft &amp; unstructured. The consistency is very runny, &amp; serum-like. I applied it with a dense concealer brush, &amp; found it to be incredibly easy to blend-out. Immediately after dry-down, it felt very light on my skin, like I wasn't wearing makeup at all. It resulted in a very dewy, glowing undereye look. I didn't find it to crease on me at all.¬† I achieved light coverage with this concealer, &amp; feel that it would be a great formula to consider for 'no-makeup' makeup days. I think dry/normal/combo skin would most benefit from this concealer.

üëâ Shop Miss A - Amuse Face Palette 


First-Impression Review: I just recently showcased this palette in a video, &amp; there was a lot of interest in it! I figured I'd include it today, &amp; take a more in-depth look at it. This palette contains three products: bronzer, blush, &amp; highlight. I prefer a face palette that accomplishes at least two steps, &amp; this one can fulfill three. Although slightly dark, I can make the highlight shade work on my skintone if I use it in a diffused method. Both the bronzer &amp; blushes suit me very well. All included powders have excellent blendability &amp; pigmentation. As for the actual pan sizes, I find them to be too narrow to fit my entire brush without accidentally dipping into a neighboring shade. Looking at color differentiation - I find that the blush shades are extremely similar, almost not warranting both to be in the same palette. Considering the price - I find that overall, it's a great deal.

üëâ Item Beauty - Brow Chow Ultra-Fine Brow Definer 


First-Impression Review: I love, LOVE testing out brow products! Honestly, when I took a close look at this one, I thought I was going to struggle immensely. However, this was the biggest surprise of the day - this pencil worked great! It is a brow 'definer', &amp; usually definer pencils feature a large, triangular tip. On the backend, it has a miniature capped smoothing brush. Upon use, I found this pencil to be extremely smooth. It was instantaneously pigmented, too - it didn't require being built-up in order to see it.¬† I didn't find this formula to be overly waxy, either. Even though the tip is kind of large, if you use the edge of it, it IS able to create thin, hairlike strokes. The color I selected was also what I usually aim for.

üëâ Shop Miss A - AOA Studio Eyeshadow Quad 


First-Impression Review: I've never tried any eyeshadows from Shop Miss A, so I just grabbed a quad to test out the formula. This palette doesn't have the nice 'light to dark' gradient that I look for - each shade is just a midtone. This entire palette is 75% matte &amp; 25% topper, &amp; I think it's too matte-heavy for me. I would like to see more balance. The matte shadows are all very, very similar - especially when applied to the eye.¬† The topper shade doesn't have a base pigment, so you are very limited as to how to use it. Upon use, I didn't get any creasing or patchiness. I got a LOT of kickback in the pans &amp; fall-out on my face.¬† I found all the shadows to be very easy to blend-out &amp; layer. This is a more directly pigmented formula, meaning as soon as you apply it, you are going to see the color. I personally would use a palette like this for a 'no-makeup' makeup look, with only slight sculpting. It's not my next go-to, but I still think it holds a place in my collection.

üëâ Hard Candy - Flashers Plumping Serum 


First-Impression Review: I'm ALWAYS down to try a plumping gloss - the more tingling, the better. The consistency of this particular gloss is pretty thick; thick enough to form stiff peaks. There is a slight fragrance to this formula. The color that I chose is really pretty, it's an iridescent blue/purple (which is NOT good for the teeth). The applicator type is a plush paddle, &amp; I found it easy to use. Upon use, I needed to dip in the tube 4 times for my complete lip look. I found it to fill-in my lip lines, which is what I like for my glosses to do. There is also a slight stick to the finish, not terrible - but enough to promote a longer wear time. As far as the 'plumping' aspect, there was barely any tingling, &amp; I didn't notice any lip plumping results.

&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe FDA remains dedicated to keeping consumers safe from contaminated cosmetic products. As part of these continued efforts, the FDA‚Äôs most recent survey to assess certain talc-containing cosmetic products for the presence of asbestos found that all 50 samples tested negative for detectable asbestos.  
Asbestos is a known human carcinogen, and its health risks are well-documented. The FDA will continue its efforts to protect consumers by conducting further testing of talc-containing cosmetics products in order to assess the presence of asbestos. The results of the next survey will be released next year. As it has in the past, the FDA will take prompt action to inform the public and to work closely with companies to help remove any products from the market that are found to contain asbestos.‚Äù  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Additional Information  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued the [final results](https://www.justtherealnews.com/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/talc) from the agency‚Äôs year-long sampling assignment to test talc-containing cosmetic products for the presence of asbestos. The full Fiscal Year 2020-2021 results show that all 50 samples assessed were negative for asbestos.  
&gt;  
&gt;Talc is an ingredient used in many cosmetics, from baby powder to blush.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the fall of 2018, the FDA formed the Interagency Working Group on Asbestos in Consumer Products, with members from eight federal agencies to support the development of standardized testing methods for asbestos and other mineral particles of health concern in talc that could potentially affect consumer product safety. On February 4, 2020, the FDA held a public meeting on the preliminary recommendations from this interagency working group on testing methods for asbestos in talc and cosmetic products containing talc.  
&gt;  
&gt;The FDA will conduct another talc sampling assignment in 2022, with 50 additional talc-containing cosmetic product samples selected for blinded testing and will communicate any results that indicate the presence of asbestos, if found. The final results are expected to be released next year."

First stroke was fine, eyeliner was visible. However when I tried to fix it, and go over it more, it either smudges it, or cleans it off which I find soo weird. The eyeliner I had was a 2in1 (one side was thick, and one side was thin). I went over my eyeliner twice and noticed it did not make any difference besides smudging it off. So I thought maybe it was dry. But when I put some eyeliner on my hands, it was so black and so visible!! When when I tried to put it again on my eyes, it wasn‚Äôt as black. The one on my hand was more visible.. What am I doing wrong? Does anyone have any eyeliner recommendations in case mine isn‚Äôt good?.."

I have a warm olive undertone which greatly shifts the color of any product I use. I've been using a sample of the ABH primer for my colorful eye looks but there is a pink undertone, doesn't blend well and it creases.

So, I purchased the MAC studio concealer pot in a light beige color (they were out of the white paint pot) at the suggestion of the MAC person that was helping me. I patted on a colorful shadow yesterday to test the wear and by hour 3 I saw creasing on my eyelid. I primed the area with my Too Face Shadow Insurance primer prior to putting on the MAC concealer, so I'm not sure what else to do. Is this just something I have to accept because I have double eyelids?  When I put the concealer on my inner eye, it doesn't crease, but there are also not on my epicanthic fold."

I have always taken my makeup off like this with no issue. And like 3 eyelashes fell out when I was trying to pull some mascara bunches out.

Even brand like [Huda Beauty](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUfwg3qDeUd/) are doing that. She has been calling the photoshop culture but a lot of people called her out since she has done some filler and other stuff to her face. 

Everyone have their good and bad... but some people have more good than bad. And we have to be ok with that. I might look good if I pull myself together... but I don't look good naturally. That doesn't mean that there isn't human being that looks better than me. I'm not going to normalize that everyone have my flaws to make myself feel better. I think it's even the opposite... maybe social media in a healthy way can push us to be a better version of ourself.

Unfortunately, the brand doesn't carry a nice pink shade that shes looking for. Her favorite Becca shade was Spray and I'm wondering if anyone here knows a product thats similar in color and application.

Here‚Äôs the thing, nobody‚Äôs ever done my makeup for me before and I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt like how it turns out. 
I‚Äôm definitely not the best at doing makeup, but I‚Äôm not the worst either. 

Sometimes I watch videos of people doing their own makeup vs having a pro do it, and sometimes I just don‚Äôt like how the pro does it.

I think it would be fun to have a pro do it but since it‚Äôs for a wedding idk how much I want to risk paying $100 for it and then not even liking it at the end.

Do any of you have experience with this? Is it worth it to hire a makeup artist as a bridesmaid?"

üëâ Touch in Sol - No Poreblem Priming Eraser 


First-Impression Review: this primer is supposed to fill in pores, fine lines, &amp; wrinkles. Upon application, I found it to have a very soft, silky, silicone-like feeling. There is no fragrance to this product.¬† I used it on my largest pore-areas as well as my crow's feet wrinkles. This primer worked absolute magic on my pores &amp; crow's feet lines! It created a completely filled-in and evened-out base. Sadly, you don't get very much product in the tube, &amp; once you twist it up - you've got to be committed to the amount, because you can't twist it back down.

üëâ L'Or√©al - True Match Lumi Healthy Luminous Makeup 


First-Impression Review: this definitely has a beautiful luminous finish to it (without any unwanted shimmer or glitter). I applied it to my face with a damp beauty sponge, &amp; was only able to achieve a light coverage. I attempted to build it, &amp; was unsuccessful with gaining further coverage. For the entirety of my face, I used approximately six full pumps. I also noticed that this foundation feels quite 'heavy' on my face in relation to it being a 'weightless' formula. As far as coverage, my melasma is still peeking through, as well as some long-standing acne scarring. I am also able to see redness through this foundation. There isn't a strong noticeable fragrance to this formula, but there is is an added SPF 20, which some people may be sensitive to. Overall, this foundation appears nice on my skin, sits well, &amp; plays favorably with other products.

üëâ The Cr√®me Shop - Cover Story Full Coverage Concealer 


First-Impression Review: the first thing that I noticed about this concealer, was its robust paint-like fragrance. This concealer features a small, precision doefoot applicator. I used this formula in two ways - as a spot concealer, as well as beneath my eyes for coverage &amp; highlight. As a spot concealer - it literally didn't do anything. It blended away into nothingness as my spots were still completely visible. Under the eyes, I achieved a very light coverage. I really enjoyed the way it highlighted the undereye area without looking overdone or cakey. Going forward, I would solely use this as a highlighting product &amp; not try to attain any type of coverage from it.¬†

üëâ Grande Cosmetics - Grande Glow Plumping Liquid Highlighter 


First-Impression Review: reading over the instructions, they specifically state that this highlighter can be effectively used over a powdered base - so that's exactly how I used it. One of the most notable elements of the highlighter, is its massive doefoot applicator! Upon application, I found it extremely easy to blend out and get the right placement. In regards to this specific shade, I didn't get any unwelcome shadows or casts. After approximately one minute of sitting on my skin, it started to seriously tingle - &amp; I suppose that would be the 'plumping' aspect of this highlight. I didn't notice any 'plumping' beyond the immense tingling sensation. Lastly, this formula does have micro-glitters in it, which I know many people are opposed to.

üëâ Lorac - Pro Precision Brow Pencil 


First-Impression Review: well, this is definitely not my favorite. The irregular, rectangular shape of the tip makes it difficult to get precision hair-like strokes. Also, the tip is exceedingly large, &amp; it blocks your view of what you are trying to do. The pencil formula itself is really not great - you have to apply a LOT of pressure to see just a little pigment. It is not smooth nor creamy in the slightest. I can make this work, but it's a major hassle &amp; takes the joy out of makeup application.

üëâ Give Them Lala Beauty Lip Duo 


First-Impression Review: OMG I'm so flustered, upset, &amp; aggravated. I am annoyed that I wasted my money on this lip kit. The lip kit itself looks pretty as I put it on, but this was literally the ONLY time I get to wear it -¬† because I have to toss it. All of it. The lip liner does NOT sharpen. I sharpened &amp; wasted half of the pencil before I realized that every time a tip forms, it breaks off. There is no actual structure nor stability to the lip liner formula whatsoever. The actual lipstick? I twisted it up ONCE to use it, &amp; the mobility mechanism completely broke &amp; the lipstick is stuck in its downward position...making it unusable. This is the worst lip kit I've ever tried - where BOTH constituents were a disaster!

2265,Makeup,Starting over with makeup,"I haven't worn makeup since the pandemic started, skin care has been largely ignored too, and my stash wasn't exactly new before that because I didn't wear it often as it was.  So I'm starting over (at least with the liquids...shadows are probably generally fine but the liquids are getting tossed because goodness only knows what's growing in there after all this time).

I'm looking online and find myself very overwhelmed.  I kind of know where to start, but given my skin is also starting to age (I'm 39) I'm not sure how I was doing my makeup before would cut it and I'm sure I need to beef up my skin care since I've basically ignored it for 2 years.

Any shoves in the right direction?  Any products I should look at specifically?  Would it behoove me to just go somewhere like Ulta or Sephora and let them get me started and go from there?

Also, I'd love any recommendations for waterproof mascara and liner that does what it's supposed to do because I need those for something next month.  I like thick fluffy lashes but hate falsies so anything especially volumizing would be nice."

2267,Makeup,Makeup Kit Essentials To Ace The Perfect Bridesmaid Look,"All the eyes at the wedding aren‚Äôt on the bride alone! The bride‚Äôs sisters and besties shine throughout the wedding too. Every bridesmaid steps into the spotlight with outfit, hair, and makeup on point! Sometimes you match your look with the other bridesmaids or match it with the bride‚Äôs makeup. Whatever the plan is, the makeup should be flawless!

A great way to look ravishing throughout the event is by keeping your beauty essentials by your side like in a [**makeup kit combo**](https://in.sugarcosmetics.com/collections/gifting-collection). Nothing should be amiss when the cameras are on you, right? Make sure to have these essentials in the makeup combo set you buy for the wedding day:

**Full Coverage Concealer**

Flawless skin is a must for a special occasion. Your makeup will look absolutely bright and limitless with a concealer. Cover all blemishes with a full coverage concealer before the foundation. You‚Äôll look instantly fresh and radiant after this.

**Contour Stick**

A contour stick is super convenient and super effective. It‚Äôs going to sculpt your face and push your cheekbones up. This chiselled look is going to bring out your look and make you stand out amongst other bridesmaids.

**Bronzer**

The photographer‚Äôs lens captures everything, and you sure want to look picture perfect. Bronzer will give you a warm sun-kissed glow. It immediately wakes up your pale skin and makes you emit nothing but radiance!

**Tinted Blush**

Time to add some colour to your look. A tinted blush is going to give you those desirable rosy cheeks. Tinted blushes leave a long-lasting stain and make your skin look healthy. It instantly levels up your bridesmaid makeup.

**Shimmer Eyeshadow**

Leave all the glitter to the bride (it‚Äôs her day after all!). Shimmer eyeshadow is more subtle and translucent than the loud glittery eyeshadow. It‚Äôs going to elevate your eye makeup without being too forceful. Blend in with a base eyeshadow and you‚Äôre good to go.

**Gel Eyeliner**

This product is a must for your bridesmaid makeup look. Your eye makeup will look incomplete without it. Gel eyeliner is perfect for giving you that cat-eye look or the much sought-after winged eyes. Maybe that‚Äôs why a gel eyeliner is found in every other makeup kit combo!

**Volumizing Mascara**

There‚Äôs no need to reach out for eyelash extensions when you‚Äôve got a volumizing mascara. It gives your lashes the thickness and intensity fit for a grand event. Layer up with multiple coats for that added sensuousness to your eyes.

**Long-Lasting Lipstick**

Weddings involve a lot of photos, celebrations, and food! The only lipstick that can withstand this combination is a long-wear lipstick. It ensures that you aren‚Äôt checking on your lipstick every minute and missing out on exciting stuff at the wedding.

**Highlighter**

Can‚Äôt do without a highlighter because when the lights are on you, you should glow! Highlighter will add that final finish to your bridesmaid look. It accentuates your cheeks, nose, and chin to make you look super attractive.

**Setting Spray**

Eye makeup? Check! Contoured face? Check! Lip makeup? Check! But hey, none of that is going to stay long without a setting spray. Grab that product and spray it generously on your face to seal the makeup. Now your makeup will stay right from the time you walk down the aisle with the bride to the time she bids her goodbyes!

Make sure that all makeup complements your outfit when you hunt for face products for women! These makeup essentials will give you a glamorous look and help you steal the show at the wedding."

I love the Nudestix formula, but their Bondi Bae looks a bit too warm too. I swatched it before and it pulled very orange on me.

I'm happy to hear any suggestions for other cream type product and powders too that would work this way. That blend well for an easy, everyday natural look, but to define the cheekbones a lil bit."

2286,Makeup,Advice on eyeshadow being too distracting on blue eyes,"So I‚Äôve been on a journey this past year slowly learning about makeup and getting better at it. I‚Äôm taking it one step at a time and now I‚Äôm stuck at eyeshadow. 

So I like the idea of wearing eyeshadow, and even though my eyes are hooded I still like to try.

But here‚Äôs what I need help with. And I want to preface this by saying that I promise I‚Äôm not being vain or fishing for attention right now, I just need to paint a picture so you guys can see what I‚Äôm asking. 
I have very light bright blue eyes that are very attention grabbing whether I wear makeup or not. Think piercing husky dog blue. And I like that about my eyes. Right now the way I like to do my makeup is tight line my black eyeliner on my water line, and then use brown eyeshadow as an eyeliner. But I make sure it‚Äôs a bit faded and not a noticeable distinct line, so that it‚Äôs very subtle and not actually obvious that I‚Äôm wearing eyeliner. I like it because it draws attention to my eyes without making the focus about the eyeliner. 

I like how it looks, but for certain events I would like to be able to wear eyeshadow because it‚Äôs fancier. But every time I try out eyeshadow at home, the colors just seem to make my eyes lot more boring looking. I try to stick to brown, tan, and beige colors because I heard that those complement blue eyes well. I‚Äôve also tried an orangey color but it also just didn‚Äôt flatter my eye color. 

I‚Äôm wondering what kind of advice you guys have on this. What kind of colors should I try so that my eye color is being accentuated rather than making the makeup distracting? 

I feel like eyeshadow is distracting away from my eye color. Is there something else I should try or should I just stay away from eyeshadow?"

2291,Makeup,Ideas for a makeup advent calendar.,"So I'm a colourblind guy who knows little to nothing about makeup and need the help of all the makeup addicts out there.
But for the last three years I've made my wife a 12 day makeup themed advent calender.
Small stuff. Eye pencils,  makeup sponges etc. Usually with a small pallete for the last day. 
Each year I try to make it better than the last. Last year I added a little non makeup thing to each day. A scratch ticket or bit of candy or chocolate for example.
This year I want to make it a full 24 day calendar. But I'm really struggling for ideas. I'll probably add a couple of little bits of jewellery. 
Any ideas would be appreciated. Especially makeup or makeup adjacent. 
It's been a very tough year for us medically and I want her to know how amazing she is and how much I love her and am proud of her.

A couple of notes. 
This isn't her only present. I get her bigger makeup things, like full palletes and such for the day of Christmas. 
We live in New Zealand if that matters.

Any ideas or thoughts would be much appreciated. 
Thank you."

2328,Makeup,How to make small eyes appear bigger?,"F21 here. I have very fair skin, dark brunette hair, and blue eyes. While I appreciate the colour of my eyes, I‚Äôm not a fan of the shape. I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to describe my eye shape - they‚Äôre somewhat hooded, but also round? I‚Äôm not sure. I get told that my eyes aren‚Äôt small, but they‚Äôre not huge either. I‚Äôve tried tips on how to make eyes appear bigger with makeup, and yet in photos they don‚Äôt quite ‚Äúpop‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt help that I don‚Äôt have a ton of eyelid space, either. I‚Äôve always admired the foxy, almond eye shape, and wish I could make my eyes appear like that. I am wondering if anyone has any other suggestions other than what I already currently do, which I list below.

What I do to try to make my eyes appear bigger are winged eyeliner, concealer under my eyes, blue/navy pencil eyeliner from the center of the bottom lash line out, lightening my waterline with white eyeliner, use highlighter/shimmer on inner corner of eye, make my eyebrows arched, curl my eyelashes, and use a good quality mascara that I apply along my upper lashes (I even do another thickening coat, but make sure it‚Äôs not clumpy). I also avoid applying heavy eyeliner on my upper lid, and opt for a wing on the outer edges, though I usually make the wing part thick. I‚Äôm somewhat confused though as some websites say that liquid eyeliner (which I use) makes eyes appear smaller, so I‚Äôm not sure which is true. Some days I don‚Äôt wanna put on too much makeup so I‚Äôll just apply mascara but I‚Äôm worried my eyes will look small without the other add-ons.

I‚Äôm aware that applying false eyelashes would enhance my eyes, but I‚Äôd prefer tips/suggestions that don‚Äôt require the use of them. Are there other methods I should try (for e.g., with eyeshadow)? Thank you!"

I‚Äôd think I need at least eyeliner, mascara, and eye shadow. Primer? Foundation?

I have no idea where to start with this stuff or choosing colors. What I‚Äôm working with is probably stuff I could get at Target or Rite Aid or something.

I'm  not sure if the Bobbi Brown still makes this brush to the same quality,  I recently bought their eye sweep brush to replace my old one but the quality was so much worse than the same brush from 8 years ago.  It was very scratchy and had a completely different shape.  On the other hand, I also bought their eye blender brush at the same time and the quality is amazing, soft that it doesn't irritate my eyes and not too firm.  It seems Bobbi Brown's brush quality is hit or miss these days, so if someone has bought the Smokey Eye Liner brush in the recent years and could provide some feedback, that would be greatly appreciated.

I have the Zoeva 238 eye shader (doesn't have the same thickness/firmness) and Sigma E21 (extremely prickly and irritates my skin).  Other suggestions are welcome, thanks in advance!"

I think they worked with L'Or√©al on this film but since it's already so old, most of the things were probably discontinued or better products have beeb released in the meantime.

Like, I‚Äôve never seen any shaped like this. Neither has our family friend. And it‚Äôs throwing us all off.

Tried applying some‚Ä¶ because you know, practice‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs all kinda jacked up. I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs the shape or a general incompetence on my part.

my birthday is tomorrow and i didn't know until i went into an ulta near my moms place (near the beginning of the month) that as a platinum member i'm supposed to get a second birthday gift aside from the free item i already got.

so about 2 weeks ago i emailed ulta asking about what this second item was supposed to be. well the person who responded was very hush hush and secret about what i was supposed to get ""i'm really not supposed to tell you"" but he sent me a list of items platinum members get i then realized i should be getting a $10 off coupon... it's now the day before my birthday and the day before the last day to use that coupon, and it still hadn't arrived.

I got a little annoyed and started a chat with an ulta beauty specialist who sent me a code for a coupon and then weather on purpose or not deleted the code before i could copy it and ended the chat. obviously anything could change before tomorrow. but i suddenly understand why Sephora has so much support where i live despite the fact that ulta had more stores. 

anyway i just needed to rant about this experience cuz i think i need to step back from ulta at this stage. this is not the first time i've had bad service but i think it might be the last time i accept it from ulta. thank you for reading"

2419,Makeup,Palette Review &amp; Pictorial - Morphe: The Jaclyn Hill Palette,"[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]

‚úÖ New Saturday Palette Pictorial &amp; Review

......

‚û°Ô∏è NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the palette quality. As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 


üåü Also, this is my first time deep diving into this palette, &amp; are my true impressions. As I continue to use it in more ways, I will update you as to how my thoughts on its performance change/develop. 

......

Morphe Brushes - The Jaclyn Hill Palette ‚úå

......

üëÅ Look Created: Spotlight Eye

......

‚ö´ Packaging: 35 shades are 1.6g each, circle-shaped pans, white cardboard packaging, bi-fold, palette brand &amp; name is on front, luxe-weight, magnetic closure, large rectangle shape, no mirror inside, pans may possibly be removable (currently waiting on testing tool to arrive for more definitive assessment), shade identification is designated on a completely separate cardstock insert, to which I taped inside the inner cover. Keep in mind that the NEWLY released version of this palette has the shade names printed southward of each shadow.

......

‚ö´ Country of Origin: China

......

‚ö´ # of Shades in Palette: 35 (all eyeshadows)

......

‚ö´ Formulas Included: 3 formulas (17 mattes, 3 satins, &amp; 15 shimmers) 

......

‚ö´ Designation: warm-toned, 'pop-of-blue'

......

‚ö´ Dexterity Concerns: none

......

‚ö´ Type of Press: soft - lots of kickback in pans, slight fallout on my face; recommend doing eyes first with this palette. 

......

‚ö´ Extra Information: created in collaboration with long-time Beauty Influencer Jaclyn Hill, each shade has a unique history &amp; descriptor, cruelty-free, NOT vegan* (please see note below), no PAO on palette (may have been on original box) 


üåü Note: there are two versions of this palette floating around - the OG palette that launched in 2017, &amp; the newly made-over version that relaunched in 2020. There has been immense controversy &amp; dispute surrounding this relaunch, because the original palette was made with a vegan formula. 


Upon relaunch, the formula changed to one that was no longer vegan - yet both Morphe &amp; Jaclyn Hill have stated that the relaunched palette contains the EXACT same proprietary formula. The entire formula had, in fact, changed, including additional ingredients carmine, coconut oil, &amp; shea. 


The palette that I'm currently using for this review, is the 2017 OG vegan palette with the unchanged formula.

......

üí∞ Price: $39.00 ‚Ä¢ (Morphe Brushes)

üí≤ Price: $1.11/shade 

......

PRICE PER SHADE SCALE:

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


PRICE PER GRAM:

+ $0.69/gram¬† 

......

üîé REVIEW: 


üî∏Ô∏èPatchiness: no patchiness 


üî∏Ô∏èBlendability: very easy to blend out 


üî∏Ô∏èFallout: experienced slight fallout, the most being from matte shade 'Enchanted' 


üî∏Ô∏èShade Variance: this palette has a nice 'light-to-dark' gradient. There are a few neutral transition shades for a range of skintones. This includes an excellent formula balance ratio. 


üî∏Ô∏èFormula: 


MATTES: these mattes were very pleasant to use. They effectively blended with every brush I tried, I got them to easily build &amp; layer, I didn't experience any unwanted patchiness. Each color was definitely pigmented, &amp; the color similarity was on point. I knew I could rely on getting the same shade on my eye as to what I was seeing in the pan. 


SATINS: there are only a few of these, but I really like them. The microglitters are far smaller in size when compared to one of the shimmer shades. Applied, these have a very smooth base, with a subtle illumination that enlivens the most drab areas. 


SHIMMERS: some of these shimmers are slight, whereas other ones are pretty foiled! They are more chunky in comparison to the satin shades, &amp; have larger micro particles in them. Each shimmer shade in this palette has a base pigment, so you can use these in a variety of ways. They apply very easily with a brush, which is important to me. 


MATTE BLACK: here is my customary comment on the included matte black - the most important of all shades in a palette. To make it simple - I like this one. It's not the best I've used, but it's pretty nice. Nothing bad to say about it!

......

üî∏Ô∏èPackaging: nice; it just reminds me of Jaclyn Hill, so I think they did a really great job of picking packaging that speaks well of the creator. 

......

üî∏Ô∏èRecommendation: I've used this palette here-and-there over the years, but I never really paid attention to if it was GOOD or not. Overall, I was amazed at how easy it was to use, I love the amount of shadows to select from, &amp; all the tones just go so well together. I really do enjoy this palette, &amp; have been very happy with the results. The price per shade is 'excellent' when compared to market price. Each shadow pan holds an above-average amount of shadow per pan. People may find difficulty in storing this palette, due to its extremely large size. I am keeping this in my collection. 


‚ñ™Ô∏èIf you are interested in this palette, I would definitely recommend it.

+ easy to blend

+ range of colors to select from

+ great balance of formulas

......

+ Favorite Shade: Diva

- Least Favorite Shade: Twerk

......

üö¶ Rating: A

‚≠ê RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

2432,Makeup,"I feel like there should be colour codes for every makeup product, or at least from well known brands.","Especially lip products. I mean, colour codes like when buying art supplies. You often get a pigmentation code, like py129. If a product has that colour code I know it will be a green/gold/yellowish colour.

 That way you get a better understanding of what the colour will look like, and if you're searching for a specific colour in a product with a certain formula, that gets easier too. 

Ofc colours will look differently depending on what kind of binding it is mixed with, but still. It would make things much easier imo. And, yes, it is very good that we can find reviews with swatches when ordering online. But still, it would be a dream if makeup companies did this.

Setting spray and powder? check. No sweating, crying, etc. I just can't figure it out, and it's super frustrating. I have slightly hooded eyes so I'm wondering if things are getting trapped in the crease of my eyelid."
2437,Makeup,Interested in completely overhauling makeup collection,"I use a ‚Äúcc‚Äù cream from it cosmetics with a setting powder but I‚Äôm not in love with how it works with my combination skin- it looks great in the morning when I first put it on although a bit cakey in the powdered areas, but then it melts and looks oily rather quickly throughout the day. I have their under eye concealer also but I hate it - very thick and hard to apply so I pretty much just rely on the cc cream but it‚Äôs not the greatest coverage for dark circles. I was recently married and my makeup artist used Mac products and I liked the result. I know that like 95% of this was probably her technique, but now I‚Äôm left wondering if I should be using different products. I don‚Äôt mind a makeup overhaul at this point but am kind of clueless on where to start, especially since makeup counters near me are not applying makeup to customers right now due to covid. Any direction you have would be great!"
2438,Makeup,Wide set brows,"So the inner brow hairs of mine start quite far apart from each other, no I haven‚Äôt over plucked I don‚Äôt really pluck my eyebrows.

Is it possible to just micro-blade my front brow hairs?"
2439,Makeup,Eyeshadow won‚Äôt stick to inner corners.,"I‚Äôve been struggling with applying eyeshadow for a few years now. No matter what I do, no shadow seems to want to stick to my inner corners. I‚Äôve tried prepping with several primers (mac eye primer, NYX, Too faced, Mac paint pot), moisturizing the area, packing in the color as much as I can, and still, the product applies patchy and comes off shortly after. 

The skin in that area is a bit hooded, so maybe that‚Äôs contributing to the issue?

2447,Makeup,Update: Weird Pointy Lipstick Applied to tiny human.,"
[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/qj69eq/how_to_apply_weird_pointy_shaped_lipstick_to_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

So, to bring everything to a close, just thought I would do a little update.

I ended up getting one of the elf concealer brushes to apply the lipstick. Ended up sort of dabbing it on the lipstick and brushing it on. It was a significantly better outcome than the first attempt. It was oddly similar to dry brush painting miniatures.

Additionally, based on the whims of a 5 year old, the tiny human decided she did not want the eye shadow. So literally the only thing she wanted to wear was the lipstick.

It lasted about 5 minutes into the evening, at which point it was largely removed by her eating a hershey bar. One of my friends was handing out full bars.

All in all, I guess we‚Äôll count it as a win.

Thank you to everyone for the advice."

2467,Makeup,Male. Brothers wedding coming up. Want to contour my face whilst looking like I haven't got any makeup on,"Hi people ;) 

Wedding is in 3 weeks. I'm not in my best shape but I'm trying.

I want to contour my face, and I want it to stay on my face even when I sweat, or get really cold outside. It's an evening wedding. The YouTube tutorials I've seen have people put on a lot of concealer/foundation - I want to avoid these. 

From what I have gathered, this could be my plan of action:

1. Moisturizing cream - a LOT of it. 
2. Pore reducing primer on the cheek areas 
3. Powder contour thing - and make a Zoolander pose face, apply the contour thing on the hollows
4. Use a beauty blender and dab the hell out of it, but softly 
5. Dab gently with a makeup brush
6. Translucent setting powder (not translucent powder?)
7. Setting spray
8. Act cool.

What do you think? Is there anything I should do differently? 

I have put on concealer and foundation before on my face and personally for me it looks way too obvious for someone who's trying to look like they have nothing on. If I put concealer, sometimes especially if the weather gets colder (which it is now), it flakes too. 

I am Iraqi and have medium brown skin.

I use clear mascara whenever I put on makeup, so I have *some* experience with it, just not black or any other mascara. I've never used eyeliner, but I am willing to try that as well. I'm honestly nervous with trying any dark colors like black or brown because of how pale my skin is, but I'll never know how it looks until I try it. Any recommendations on what lashes I should try?

I love the way waterproof mascara holds the curl that I make with the lash curler the WHOLE ENTIRE DAY, like it‚Äôs been freshly curled!

I have very sensitive skin. I breakout easily and try to limit the products I use on my skin because of that. (Non-makeup related but I can‚Äôt even use scented detergent or dryer sheets or I‚Äôll get hives)

I have had my makeup done professionally once before. They used an airbrush makeup (unsure of the brand). I had an allergic reaction to it and looked like a tomato within an hour after application. 

I am in need of finding a long lasting makeup with medium coverage that I can use for my wedding day. I won‚Äôt be using a professional as it‚Äôs just a small, micro wedding with 25 guests. Nothing fancy. BUT, I still want to look and feel my best!

Any advice or suggestions would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

Maybe cuz I‚Äôve crossed the other side of my 30‚Äôs and own over 11,000 neutral palettes all purchased for that Pop of Bronze Foil Gold Shimmer. We‚Äôve been at it since high school and we‚Äôre happily married and had several Shimmer babies. But like‚Ä¶should we get a divorce? 
It‚Äôs just that lately I‚Äôve been looking more at Mattes (I know I know, outside of my marriage how disgusting). I‚Äôve always thought Mattes were so boring! I needed that pep, that sparkle, that Oomph. I was young! Matte was always a reliable friend and everything, laying the base, contouring your peeps, blending your shit, helping you move. But at the end of the night, you know I be fucking with Shimmer. Get my brush WET, dig in deep, lay it on thick. We were happy.

But like, lately I‚Äôve been hanging more and more with Skincare. And I like what it‚Äôs done for ME. I‚Äôm glowing more, my skin feels healthier. And now my vibe with Shimmer is all off. My Highlight doesn‚Äôt get me off as much and just makes me look sweaty. And my beloved Shimmer lid kinda looks like it‚Äôs trying too hard now. It doesn‚Äôt look dignified partying like that at our age, screaming for attention. 

But you know‚Ä¶the love is still there. I can‚Äôt deny it. We have so much Herstory together and I just‚Ä¶I dunno. 

Anyone else feel this way sometime? Anyway, thanks for listening‚Ä¶

2588,Makeup,Extreme self esteem problems,"I‚Äôm a teen in high school and around 3-4 years ago I ran into some issues with my weight. I thought that skipping meals would make people like me more since in middle school I was made fun of but not necessarily for my weight ever. I was very awkward and what most people would consider unattractive. So I began to drop weight like crazy and eventually my friends said they‚Äôd tell someone. Fast forward a year and I started to get into makeup, it started out very natural and light but it turned into a full face for school every single day. The guys and girls that made fun of me now paid extra attention to me. I was called beautiful by everyone even some of my siblings guy friends and soccer teammates. Problem is that I look disgusting without it and I have to wake up early every morning to put on this mask. And even after years my weight problem has never gone away, I throw out lunch at school to stay under a weight and I refuse breakfast. I get extreme guilt and panic when I go over a set number of cals. I cant tell my mom or an adult because my own mom even said I‚Äôm wearing too much makeup and asked what I‚Äôd do if these boys saw me without it. And when I tried opening up to her about my diet problem when it first started my phone was taken and that was that. Now I can go without social media I‚Äôm not like that but that‚Äôs how I‚Äôd talk to my friends who have my back. My mom cares but just don‚Äôt understand.

2610,Makeup,Should There Be Travel Sized Foundation?,"I‚Äôd like to hear what you guys have to say :)

For me, I think that companies should start creating smaller sizes of foundation because it‚Äôs something that is so unique to everyone, but there are too many options out there. How can someone find their ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù or discover a brand that suits them better if they‚Äôre spending time finishing up their current full sized bottle.

Full sized foundations take a long time to get through, and bottles can expire before it‚Äôs all used up. This is especially true for those two alternate between different brands at once. There will never be enough time to finish it before it expires. Not to mention the bulkiness of bottles of liquid foundation that can be a struggle while traveling. 

Id rather try the mini sizes to test out everything in a foundation without having to be fully committed to spending $40 on a bottle of foundation that looked good as a swatch but not on my face. 

Sample sized packets usually only contain enough for one application, which isn‚Äôt enough to test out the long term effects of wear (if it contributes to acne, too drying ect.) 

We have travel sized everything from lip kits to eyeliner, it would be nice if mini sizes of foundation were offered as well. 

I can see how some people could say travel sized is wasteful packaging, but I find that having to toss out a half empty expired full-size wasteful as well. 

Also Im aware that expiration dates don‚Äôt always have to be followed, but after a few years of almost daily use, I think my foundation has to go no matter how full it is.  

So should there be a mini/ travel sized foundation in your opinion?"
2611,Makeup,Foundation mixer for a *slight* touch of luminosity?,"Hey folks! I'm looking for some suggestions on a foundation mixer.


As summer is winding down, my combo/oily skin is getting a bit less oily. At the beginning of summer I started using the Urban Decay Stay Naked foundation and I LOVE it. Perfect shade match, lasts as long as I need it to, stays looking fresh all day. But as my skin is getting closer to ""normal"" and less oily (which is typical for me in the fall/winter months) my foundation is starting to look a little dry. Not cakey, at least not yet, but dry. I am not at all in the mood to shop for another foundation lol so I'd rather mix something into it to tone down the matte finish a bit.



I tried the Glow Recipe dew drops and honestly it was exactly what I was after. Not sure if the magic is in the drops or the foundation, but I mixed equal amounts of both and didn't sacrifice coverage in any way, and the foundation was still matte but with just a *touch* of luminosity. Perfection. So of course my stupidly sensitive skin had a reaction to the dew drops. My cheeks got red and inflamed and got a mess of small red bumps everywhere. Just lovely!



Next I brought out an old tube of the Dr. Brandt luminizer primer and mixed that in with the foundation. It was nice enough, definitely toned down the dry appearance, but it didn't look as natural as the dew drops did. Neither does any of my moisturizers, and those also sheered the foundation a lot more.



Does anyone have any suggestions for a good mixer? Anything out there similar to the dew drops? I just really loved the touch of luminosity without having any shine, shimmer, or glitter. I'd prefer to stay from oils, I've had too many do me wrong in the past. But I'm open to just about anything else, primer, serum, moisturizer, etc. I'd prefer something I can get at Sephora since it's most convenient for me, but I'm not married to that idea.



Thanks in advance and sorry for the novel!"

The texture, bumpiness, and makeup separation is the real problem.

2615,Makeup,My colors don‚Äôt work anymore!! (Choosing makeup in 30s),"I‚Äôm 32 and over the past several months I‚Äôve been realizing with increasing awareness that my makeup colors that worked for me amazingly for the last 10 years don‚Äôt work at all anymore. They literally don‚Äôt match my skin anymore, look weird and clownish instead of bright and fresh and - I don‚Äôt get it. I know styles change but this isn‚Äôt that. The colors literally no longer compliment me.

Not only that, the foundation that worked just last year seems‚Ä¶ oddly bright and unnatural to my eyes now. I think I‚Äôm still getting away with it but‚Ä¶ I seriously don‚Äôt know what to do.

Are there any articles anyone knows of regarding changing shades in your 30s, what causes it (scientifically speaking, not just ‚Äúage‚Äù), and how to figure out what colors will work?"

The colors are PERFECT. The formula is so soft and amazing. The packaging though‚Ä¶ none of the liners retract!! I can‚Äôt roll them up to get more product or roll them down to protect the product. It‚Äôs crazy! I actually thought I was losing my mind. I brought one to the store and asked the sales rep if I was insane‚Ä¶ she couldn‚Äôt get it either and ended up breaking the eyeliner. I read the reviews; apparently this is a common issue. I‚Äôm returning the rest and am so disappointed! 

What are your favorite eyeliners that are soft, smudgy, and easy to blend? I love smoked out liner looks and really like interesting colors. I won‚Äôt use them in my waterline so they don‚Äôt need to be waterproof or have amazing staying power. Something slim and retractable (not one you sharpen) would be ideal.

2661,Makeup,makeup tips for masculine faces,"Info: please excuse any spelling errors, I'm from europe lol

Hi all! 
I geniunely love wearing make up but these days I don't really have the time and patience to do a full glam everyday and I try to stick to a more natural look, since I work at an office. Problem is: I have very strong masculine features and people sometimes even confuse me for a guy, which is...not so great to hear, for me personally. Basically I look like my dad, but with longer hair. üôÉ
Usually I put on a heavy eyeliner, to accentuate my eyes, but I really love the no makeup look with just a bit of brown eyeshadow used as eyeliner. I have a slight 5 o clock shadow on my upper lip (thanks dad for making me extra hairy), a huuuuge forehead and of course thin but very defined lips, which are impossible to overline without looking ridiculous. (I've tried, trust me)
I've been thinking about a forehead reduction and lip fillers, which would solve 99% of my problems but probably add up a lot of new ones and make me poor, considerind I'd have to touch up the latter every few months and risk to look like a duck, with all that bad migration I've been seeing. 

So are there any girls struggling with this as well? Do you guys have any tips for me? I'd prefer to wear less makeup, just doing a cute parisian ""no makeup"" makeup look, but I feel like that's not possible.

Not a natural finish, but a true glowing finish. It seems like most of the full coverage foundations are either matte or natural finish. I have dry, very dull plain skin so even something with a natural finish still seems to look kind of matte on me. The only thing I‚Äôve found even remotely close to what I‚Äôm looking for is the IT cosmetics illuminating cc cream, but I‚Äôm not necesarily looking for a product that has all the added skin care benefits as I properly prep my skin before hand. Thanks in advance!"

Hi yes I'm new.

Yesterday I by accident disvovered this neat little eyeshadow at my local UD stand called ""Tonic"". I swatched it and was smitten immediately, but then I looked at the price - 23‚Ç¨ (that's 26$ atm folks) and I laughed and laughed and laughed all the way home.
Then I tried searching it online and I'm not laughing anymore. 

Are those UD duochromes really discontinued?? 
Is there still some place I can try and buy these online? Does this mean I'll have to grab it from my store while it can still be grabbed at all full (and jacked up euro tax) price be damned?

And lastly, do any of you perhaps know some good dupes for these before I go and murder my piggy bank for literally one single eyeshadow (or two)?
Plus I haven't even seen lounge, but brick red base with green/blue shifts is my kryptonite in concept alone. If anyone could confirm that it looks as green-shifty irl as it does in photos oh that'd be great.

Now, I know the basics of contouring. I need to find makeup that matches my skin, which is pale with a lot of pink/red tones. I'm looking to generally go for that vampiric aesthetic, maybe not solid white, but definitely on the paler side. My question is though, for someone with a face between round/triangle, how would you contour onto pale makeup well? Do you use just a shade darker? Most goths just stick with Black or Grey, but if I were to aim to keep it more natural, what would be the best colours, and approach?  


I know about using a green to cover my face, but haha, I have the Hard Candy liquid Green and I think it does a kinda shit job prepping my face? I need a primer too, is Witchhazel fine until I get into the big leagues and buy a $40+ bottle?  


And while being greedy and desperately new, I would like to approach the vampiric look with some eye shadow. Now my eyes are a Grey/Green, and barely look blue until I wear a lot of black. I am a long haired ginger as well (I'll post a face pic to those who might need it for reference.)

\- Maybelline Fit Me Matte (The only foundation I use however I always mix it with some green primer to get that perfect shade match, if not then the foundation on its own is a smidge dark/orange on my skin)

But recently I burned, bad, on my nose in less then 10 minutes. My new medication apparently makes me more susceptible to sun damage. So, I need a sunscreen recommendation- and I‚Äôm unfortunately picky‚Ä¶ please help! Here‚Äôs the issues I‚Äôve had with sunscreens in the past.

1. I don‚Äôt wear makeup daily, so a foundation based sunscreen is out
2. I have quite sensitive skin, and some sunscreens have caused reactions.
3. Another medication I take causes heat sensitivity, so I sweat a lot- especially on my face. This is made worse by heavy sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt let my skin breathe. That means Ive sweat off the sunscreens I have tried. 

I swear I‚Äôm genuinely trying to get help with this, my skin is a gremlin that is impossible to please. I don‚Äôt want skin cancer. However, I have to be firm on not wearing makeup daily, not because I don‚Äôt want to, but becuase it‚Äôs not permitted in some of the rooms in my work for safety reasons. In this particular chemical lab, our faces are supposed to be clear of anything that is not PPE. We also are a testing laboratory, so the rule is also to avoid contamination of any kind. Yes the rules are frequently bent (try to prove someone‚Äôs wearing mascara without grabbing their eye) but foundation is just not a feasible option for me each day. Any other suggestions welcome!

2718,Makeup,Maybelline Matte Ink - what am I doing wrong?!,"So after reading a lot about this liquid lipstick and everyone and their mother falling over themselves to sing its praises and how it won't come off no matter what, I bit the bullet when it was on sale last week. 

It's very disappointing so far. After making a total mess the first few times I applied it, I finally got that part down but... Eating, drinking, kissing... It just comes right off, smudges all around my mouth, I leave stains on everything and everyone. It's terrible. I do use lots of lip balm but having read the instructions of this lipstick, I remove everything from my lips before application to make sure my lips are as dry a canvas as possible so the product can adhere to them. But no matter how much or little product I use, it stays sticky for quite a bit and never seems to fully dry. I blot and set with powder and don't do anything to my lips for hours after application but first time my lips touch anything, it'll be ruined immediately. 

Am I doing something wrong? Why doesn't it budge for everyone but me?!"

It leaves behind a sorta ‚Äúi just ate a popsicle‚Äù vibe that I love. I assume it lasts a few days? Are those things real, and if so, is there any reason I shouldn‚Äôt use them?

2. I have super pale skin and I want to put on a foundation. However, I don't know anything about contouring and don't want to try either. Is there a foundation that is sheer that just kind of evens out color and pores? I don't need the appearance of flawless skin, just a bit more cohesive.
3. I have hair issues and much of my eyebrows have stopped growing altogether. I'd like to get a real true eyebrow filler rather than just using eyeshadow. I have no idea what is good. I've used pencils and hate them. I have more control with a brush. Are there any good brow filler that uses mainly a brush? Are there any that are long lasting, slightly staining the skin? 

Thank you to anyone who answers these questions and helps me out!! I very much appreciate any advice!"

üëâ Essence Cosmetics - 'MySkin Perfector' Tinted Primer 


First-Impression Review: this primer has a very soft, silicone feeling. I used wayyyy too much, &amp; found that a little bit goes far. It smells fresh &amp; almost citrus-y. Upon application, I found that it really covered my redness, &amp; did an INCREDIBLE job filling in my pores. I used it alongside a very trusted foundation, &amp; this primer did NOT work well under the foundation. I found my base to not apply over certain areas of my face, &amp; my entire base looked extremely patchy. I will continue using this to find if &amp; how I can get it to work.

üëâ Covergirl - 'Clean Invisible' Concealer 


First-Impression Review: the first thing that I noticed is that my most-closely matched shade is a VERY cool-tone. Interesting. I found this to have a sweet, perfumed scent. Upon application, I was able to easily blend the concealer out &amp; achieve a medium-coverage level. Right after blending, the overall appearance looked kind of patchy, but I didn't get any creasing. It also played well with trusted powder application.

üëâ E.L.F. Cosmetics - 'Putty' Bronzer 


First-Impression Review: I honestly was SO excited for this, &amp; had high hopes that this was going to perform wonderfully. The product itself feels very soft &amp; creamy to the touch, &amp; it spreads well &amp; evenly over the skin. There is absolutely no fragrance to it, &amp; the color is a beautiful bronze. Upon application, I became very distressed as this bronzer formula COMPLETELY picked-up &amp; removed all of my base products. It looked so horrible on my face! Again, I will play around with this bronzer to see if/how I can get it to perform. 


‚û°Ô∏è Shade: Honey Drip

üëâ Kokie Cosmetics - 'Blush Up' Blush Palette 


First-Impression Review: even though each color is beautiful on its own, when I'm presented with a palette - I just have to mix all the shades together! The mixture created a single, beautiful compound shade. There is zero fragrance to these powders. Upon application, I was able to effectively place the blush into position, &amp; then easily blend it out. After blending, I noticed that these powders actually have a 'satin-finish' (they are not completely matte), so it REALLY enhanced the texture beneath the applied product. 


‚û°Ô∏è Shade: BL754 Demure

üëâ Beauty Creations - Eyeshadow Palette 


First-Impression Review: I have great history with Beauty Creation's eyeshadows, they've always outperformed my expectations. This palette isn't an exception. I just absolutely love it. The mattes blend &amp; layer nicely. The metallics are SPECTACULAR. They even pick up so well on a brush for precision placement. I really like the gradient in this color-story, &amp; that each shade serves a purpose. I did experience a lot of kick-up in the pans with very little fall-out.

üëâ NYX Professional Makeup - 'Slide On, Glide On, Stay On, &amp; Definitely a Turn On, Waterproof, Extreme Color' Lip Liner 


First-Impression Review: this lip liner is of the 'sharpenable pencil' variety. The formula is reminiscent of a gel formula, without the smearing of a simple gel. It truly does glide easily - there was absolutely no skipping or drag. This particular color isn't my favorite, but it's just 'okay'. I really like that this lip liner works to blur out the lip line's edges to create a soft-effect.

I have slightly oily skin and my brows are really dark compared to the hair on my head (blonde), so it was kind of a pain trying so many. I read so many reviews, watched so many YouTube videos... and no dice.

Well, fast forward to the other day -- I randomly grabbed a brow pencil in Target thinking I haven't searched for a dupe in a while. Didn't read reviews, guessed on the color, thought it was cheap ($7-$8) and didn't think much of it. Lo and behold, IT FREAKING WORKS. It's creamy yet long lasting, the color is beauuuutiful, and the price is 1/3 of ABH! It's called L'Oreal Paris Brow Stylist Definer Eyebrow Mechanical Pencil.

Just wanted to put this out there in case any other oily or picky ABH fans haven't yet found a dupe that actually works!"

Any tips? I will for sure straighten my hair but I might tie it up or keep it down. My hair will eventually get curly from the sweat on my forehead :( or the humidity if it rains that day. Please give me advice and let me know what you do on this situation. I also wore jeans because if I wear shorts I‚Äôll get thigh chafing. I guess I might wear jeans and a tank top.

Sadly, that is very hard to find if you have skin that is already dry. I have tried pretty much every long wear matte foundation, including the regular double wear. I have also tried the hydra rescue foundation, which is still too glowy for me. Do any dry skin persons use EL maximum cover? Or tried it? What was your experience?

2807,Makeup,Eyeshadow Creasing/smudging,"Hey everyone!

I've been having problems lately with my eyeshadow creasing on my eyelids. I go to work and several hours later realize my eye makeup has completely deteriorated and I look a little crazy (my job involves moving furniture and with the hot weather lately I've been sweating more). I looked in the history here and saw a couple of posts recommending primer and setting spray, some brand specific, but I'm wondering if it has to be a primer specific to eyes?

I subscribed to Ipsy until very recently and have a few face primers that I haven't tried yet, but I'm not super sure what the difference is. My makeup routine is simple and quick - eyes only - I'm an 'out the door fifteen minutes after I wake up' type! Does anyone have any input on face primer vs. eye primer and a solution that wouldn't take super long?

Thank you!"

2810,Makeup,How to use this contour+color corrector pallette,"Hi, I have a color corrector + contour and highlighter pallette. Its by beauty runway, it came with a picture guide but I found that the colors did not match the ones on the actual palette.

I have only ever used powder contour, theres like 3 of 4 different shades. 1 that is super light beige, and then 3 variations of brown. Im pretty pale, should I go with the lightest brown? Or does each shade contour a different part? (like jaw, cheekbone, forehead) 

Also what kinda brush should I use to apply it? :/ I dont know if its a good idea to use the brushes which I use for powder. I have an elf stiple brush which ive kinda just been using for the color correctors, and also some que tips for ance spots."

2872,Makeup,Any skincare products to get rid of acne?,"Hello! I know that many of you have faced problems such as acne. Perhaps, some of you are still fighting with acne and post-acne scars despite no longer being teens. Maybe someone has already obtained a victory in this battle and can share some beauty tips. It would be interesting to find out which products you‚Äôve tried already and can recommend to the rest?

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I cannot say that I have got rid of all the imperfections. I still do have blemishes from time to time. However, I found some products that can help me more or less.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If we talk about brands such as Clinique, Kiehl‚Äôs, and Garnier. I‚Äôm not gonna waste your time and talk about those brands. The only thing I would like to mention is that they are 100% effective, at least for me. Maybe you have noticed the same thing. That‚Äôs why I want to talk about the products you have tried already and saw some positive improvements in your skin? 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you can also suggest some masks, scrubs, or serums? For instance, my friend recently recommended me a watermelon sleeping glow mask. I‚Äôve checked some reviews online, and it says that it also helps the prone to acne skin and even helps to get rid of post-acne scars. But, I‚Äôm the type of person who wants to double-check all the reviews and ask for more feedback about specific products before I buy them and put them on my face or body. Besides, I‚Äôm not a big fan of sleeping masks, but if it‚Äôs really gonna help me, I will put it all over my face.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I hope that this topic will be helpful for those who have acne problems at any age, and everyone can suggest some products and share their feedback."

2899,Makeup,"Do I have neutral, olive, peach, warm, or cool undertones?"," Hello everyone.

I'm not used to wearing makeup and after asking Sephora employees:

NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer in Honey for base (ended up too light plus beigy pink and kind of dirty looking on me).

Fenty Eaze Drops: #12 was a tad darker and orange looking.

I've ordered some NARS Radiant creamy concealers, and quite frankly stumped:

Custard  - seems to match as an undereye 

Crema Catalana - similar to Custard  

Marron Glace - yellow-ish on my cheeks Biscuit - matches my forehead and chin but after swatching on my arm which is darker than my face, looks burnt red? 

Praline - Orangey/peachy? 

Truffle contour = dark peach

Hi all, I am have completed a total of 12 laser tattoo removal session, and it has left me scarred, that is‚Äîhypo-pigmentation, hypopigmentation, and some areas of the tattoo color is still visible, especially the red and orange colors. My tattoo is located on the left side of my neck, and it covers most of the side. 

I read a few post regarding tattoo/scar coverage topic, but some of the language is foreign to me because I‚Äôm a guy haha. What I understood is I need a concealer, setting power with talc in it, and a setting spray. 

Dermablend as a concealer; Ben Nye as the setting powder with talc; and Huda Beauty setting spray comes up a lot as recommended products. 

I hope I did okay with understanding some of the basics of coverage application, and was hoping members can elaborate with additional  product recommendations, techniques, tools, video, etc.

A couple years ago I had bad acne that has now cleared up after years of struggling, I don't think my skin has ever looked better and I'm so happy.
My only problem now is my confidence, I always seems to be red, I'm fine at home when I'm lounging about but the slightest touch or the second I go out I'm bright red. 
I really want some confidence and I think makeup would be a good way to boost it, its not something I want to wear everyday but just for the times I want to look a bit nicer.
I have nowhere to start, No one I'm my family is that into makeup and a lot of YouTubers are way out of my budget. I love Zoe Suggs makeup look (2020-2021) but I want something that doesn't cost much.
I'm looking for something light not cakey, good for sensitive skin, wont rub off my face onto other things like bedding or clothing, good for big pores, my face isn't really oily or dry it depends on the day and something that is simple because I have no makeup technique. I don't think a foundation is good for me, maybe just a Concealer that I can put all over my face.

2962,Makeup,Fake eyelash help,"I have been wearing fake eyelashes for a couple of weeks now. I use Ardell fauxmink eyelashes with Kiss Lash Glue Liner. And I've noticed that my natural lashes seem shorter and less full. Is there something I'm doing wrong or can do to stop this from happening? Or is this normal? I put the lash glue as close to right above my natural lashes as I can. 

Also I'm using a cotton round with Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water to take off all my make up but it doesn't do the best job getting the glue off. So I'm rubbing at my eyes a lot. Is there something better I could use? Or could that be the reason my eyelashes seem to be falling out?

2976,Makeup,Dermaflage as a scar filler?,"I have lots of acne scars on cheeks and even though they are not severe...they are noticeable and look horrible under harsh lighting. I have no faith in treatments...none of them removes scars unless they are fresh scars and very shallow. Doctors charge lots of $$$ for these treatments not to mention the awful looks and downtime after each treatment (only to get a 5-10% improvement???). I've read so many reviews of patients that see immediate results which are swelling and redness and once they are gone their scars are almost the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Acne scars are not wrinkles, even rich people have acne scars; treatment results are minimal.

My only hope is concealing acne scars, using something that works like putty. There must be something that conceals acne scars...they are just indentation on our skin...it's all about filling them in. Silicone primers, eyelash glue...have you tried any of these?? 

I've also seen amazing results on YouTube there's a make up called dermaflage which matches your skin colors and texture. Has someone tried it?? Is it difficult to apply and blend in? Does it last long enough?"

2986,Makeup,Can you recommend me free resources &amp; courses for complete beginners?,"Hi everyone

I'm completely new around here and almost clueless about makeup. I only know basic stuff - but I'm super into skincare. So I've been thinking for a while that the next step forward is to think really well about using the right make-up products for me that work for *my* features, rather than copy whatever works on someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, there's so much information (and misinformation) out there that I don't even know where to start. I'd be tempted to take a free or cheap make-up basics course but there are so many of them and how do I even know if the tutor is at least accredited to teach others and knows what they're talking about?

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I'd be super grateful if you pointed out where to find the basics. I'm talking things like:

* how to pick the right brushes &amp; tools - what do I need?
* what ingredients to look for/avoid in makeup for my skin type
* how to pick the right products/advice on various brands and how to filter them
* how to find out what makeup works for my facial features and my concerns
* how to apply products appropriately and in what order
* what's the appropriate make-up for different dress codes
* matching the make-up with the outfit, hair and other colours in my appearance
* is there anything else?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot!!

2989,Makeup,Why do makeup artists always do a bad job with my makeup?,"I‚Äôve had a few events in the past few years where I‚Äôve gotten my makeup professionally done and I always think it looks absolutely terrible. They use a ton of brown even though I have blue green yes and blond hair and tell them I want something light. I tell them that I don‚Äôt have much definition around my eyes and want some but they use brown eye shadow instead of black ye liner. I don‚Äôt have great skin and the foundation always ends up looking cakey. They also always put a ton of really light powder all around my eyes. None of the eye makeup ever compliments my eyes or makes them pop as well as I do with very basic makeup. This never seems to be the case with the other people who have gotten their makeup done at the same time. When I‚Äôve done my makeup in the past I mostly do a mild Smokey eye with a little bit of black on the outside and a light sparkly color on most of the eye lid and then black eye liner. My eyes look amazing, but nobody ever does this even if it‚Äôs the type of makeup they put on other women. Am I supposed to ask for something specific? Tell them I don‚Äôt like brown?"
2990,Makeup,Finally found eyeshadow that I love and its actually pigmented!!,"So my skin tone is more olive/tan and for years I've struggled trying to find pigmented enough eyeshadow that will actually show up on my skin. Many of the eyeshadow palettes I've used before would work just fine on fair skin but it literally just barely shows up on my skin. 

Anyways I was on instagram one day and came across a small business that promised extra pigment and quality products at affordable prices so I decided I'd check an eye palette out just for kicks. 

Oh my gosh am I so glad I did. The brand name is Euphoric Sun and they're based in California if I remember correctly and their palettes are 16-18 us dollars apiece, cruelty free and vegan. They also have the ingredients listed on the back so you know whats in it.

The colors are vibrant and super pigmented, they don't cause me to have any allergies that I've had to numerous eyeshadow palettes before, the product sits comfortably on the skin to the point where it doesn't feel like I am wearing anything. It lasts all day, and i even tested it in water and even though its not waterproof, it still holds up very well for something that isn't waterproof. The palettes come in several sizes and colors for any look. 

I can happily say I will be using their products for pretty much all my makeup needs now and I just ordered a brush set from them that I'm super excited to try. If anyone's looking for more pigmented eyeshadow that's at a fair price I highly recommend them!"

I know some youtubers mentioned some products not being beginner friendly-- but I'm not new to makeup. 

The eye paint, which looks so buttery smooth and easy to blend is the complete opposite. After what feels like two seconds, it set.  Blending feels like excessive tugging on my skin. Same goes for the shadow sticks. They're beautifully pigmented but just. don't. blend. I've tried primer, no primer, moisturizer, and nothing. It feels so different to the easily bendable products seen in her videos. I can't help but feel a little cheated.

Has anyone had the same problem? Any tips for making blending easier? I've tried primer/no primer. Moisturizer. everything I can think of.

3044,Makeup,How to get liquid eyeliner off my favorite shirt,"The eyeliner is wet n wild waterproof liquid eyeliner and I went on vacation and while Im here, I opened it and it like exploded everywhere. It's super wet and runny and it got all over the counter and my clothes. It's never done this before, my only guess is it got too hot."

3046,Makeup,Makeup Artist Pricing,"Hey all,

Recently my makeup business has really taken off and I am struggling to establish my pricing with all of the new requests. I am excited for all the wonderful opportunities rolling in but I work full time as it is, and as I sacrifice more of my free time, I really want to make it worth my while. 

Most of the gigs are weddings.. I wanted to get a feel of what reasonable rates are for the brides, bridal parties, travel.. etc.. 

Any advice is welcome! Thank you for reading"

3048,Makeup,Does anybody have any tips to avoid concealer from smudging when wearing sunglasses?,"I love wearing sunglasses, but when I take them off, there are smudges where the nose pads were sitting. Does anyone have tips and tricks to make that not happen or even prevent such harsh smudges?"
3049,Makeup,Must have makeup for beginners?,Hey y‚Äôall! I‚Äôm 20f and just started playing around with makeup. üò≥ I grew up in a really religious household and we just didn‚Äôt wear it and since I moved out I just have felt weird wearing it and a little insecure. Any tips and products you love?!
3050,Makeup,Best drugstore highlighter stick,Hey all so I‚Äôm a drugstore makeup girl through and through except for my highlight. I use Fenty matchstix in the shade Starstruck because it‚Äôs just my favorite color on me but I wanna see if there‚Äôs a dupe in the drugstore that isn‚Äôt as much. Can anyone help me out?
3051,Makeup,Which makeup counter for DIY wedding makeup? Lightweight and natural,"Hi! I‚Äôm getting married in a few weeks at the courthouse and getting dinner with our families after. I want to do my own makeup and since the pandemic, I have a chance to restock. I want to go for a very natural, dewy fresh look that will last all day and look nice in pictures. 

I‚Äôm used to wearing minimal makeup and even a CC cream can feel heavy sometimes. I used to wear exclusively Clinique since I know my skin agrees with it, but I‚Äôm open to another brand. I‚Äôd like to go up to the counter at a Nordstrom so I can really get a feel of what it will look like before I buy. 

What counter do you guys recommend? I‚Äôm thinking Lanc√¥me or YSL or Chanel based off of what I‚Äôve been reading‚Ä¶ but would love your feedback!"
3052,Makeup,Getting intensely discouraged by my own lack of skills. How do I overcome this?,"Hey guys. I am a nonbinary person, who just reignited their love for makeup. I remember a year ago I went to sephora and bought a set of brushes and a palette and some other things. Yesterday I also bought something for myself and I'm trying to practice every day. The thing is, I am so sloppy and bad at it it doesn't encourage me in any way :( I'm interested in doing drag and I've done my first time brows today and they were terrible. likewise with the eyeliner. It's just so bad, I feel like I am way worse than those who are just beginning in makeup, I must be either extremely unlucky or I just didn't do it often enough. How do I overcome this ""debbie downership""? I'd love to be a pro at makeup, but the fact that I am so bad makes me feel like it's not worth it."
3053,Makeup,Make up newbie needing advice for using magnetic lashes.,First time applying lashes of any kind. I hope this is not a dumb question but do you attach the lashes directly to the eyeliner line or the lashes? When I apply the back of the lashes to the eyeliner line the black strip the magnets are attached to looks really thick and not natural.
3054,Makeup,Do I really need a setting spray?,"I have oily, slightly sensitive, acne prone skin and I have a good skin care routine, I know that a lot of setting sprays have alcohol in them is why I ask if I really need one. All I wear is a CC cream.
I already use ELF poreless putty primer
Dermablend continuous correction tone evening cc cream spf 50"
3055,Makeup,Holy grail of red lipstick?,"Suggestions for the greatest classic red lipstick? Getting married next month and I‚Äôm going for the timeless, classic look"
3056,Makeup,Mattefying primer without Silicone?,So I have an allergy to Silicone as well as oily skin. Does anyone know of a good mattefying primer that doesn't contain Silicone? I have been searching all over but not really coming up with anything other than dewy or illuminating primer which I definitely don't need.
3057,Makeup,Why does a lot of my makeup look so bad?,"Usually I just stick with some CC cream and mascara, maybe fill in my brows.

For the life of me I can't get eyeliner on without it looking ziggy or if it's liquid eyeliner getting it in my eye. 

99% of lipsticks makes me look like an old woman (I'm 25) there's one that's kinda like my skin tone but a little darker which looks OK at first but quickly looks nasty and dry, lip gloss makes everything 10x worst. (My lips are kind of on the thin side if that mean anything).

I'm okish with eye shadow on the lids of my eyes, can't get in underneath without looking ridiculous, not brave enough to try anything besides natural/neutral colors.

I tried blush for the first time today and I think it looked OK so I'll probably add it to my usual routine.

Is my technique just crap? (Haven't worn makeup until recently)."
3058,Makeup,Cream/liquid blushes and highlighters that don‚Äôt disturb powder products?,"I apologize if this has been asked before, but could we compile a list of some foolproof, long-lasting cream/liquid blushes and highlighters that NEVER disturb foundation or powder products underneath? I love the dewy look of cream/liquid products but on the days that I wear full-coverage liquid foundation to work, I have to set my entire face with a powder foundation or translucent powder FIRST to prevent transfer. 

So far, the em cosmetics serum blush hasn‚Äôt disturbed powder foundation but it can stick to my hair. I also think I tried a canmake cream blush years ago and I don‚Äôt think it moved the products underneath either. 

Does Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs Hollywood Flawless Filter work on top of powder? I tried the beauty light wand and it kept lifting no matter which way I applied it (it was beautiful though)"

üõç New Makeup Releases ... Inspired or Tired? üßπ

‚û°Ô∏è NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding the product quality (I'm not trying to offend anybody's specific product taste). As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

This is just window-shopping the new beauty releases (one of my favorite things to do!) Sometimes, I come across some really awesome, inspiring products - other times, I feel some type of way about a few of these releases. Read on to find out if I'm 'Inspired or Tired' by these 9 new products! 


Inspired = possibly going on my wishlist 


Tired = why?

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èHaus Laboratories 'Le Monster' Lip Vault Vol. 2 - $170.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: High-End Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï I frequently check several brand websites for new releases, &amp; every time I check Haus Laboratories - they are releasing a monstrous vault with an extremely high price tag. Barely ever do I find new formulas, just the same thing repackaged to suit a higher volume of product. I get that there are collectors out there, but the sheer amount of collectible vaults that this brand releases is impractical. 

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èBechy Beauty Blends x Mystical Glamour 'Deities' Single Eyeshadows - $7.55/each 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Indie Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï Just looking at the picture, I like EVERY single shade. Indie brands know how to do a VERY good eyeshadow. I've never tried anything from this brand before, but I love this collaboration, &amp; I'd love to add some of these singles to my collection. Plus the price of them is very much on par with similar quality shades from other brands. 

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èEssence Makeup 'Brow Wax' Pen - $2.99 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Affordable Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï I couldn't tell you how many times I've tried a wax pencil, &amp; the product was just simply a fail. I look for waxes to completely change the direction of my brow hairs, &amp; anything that is pliable enough for 'stick' form isn't as strong as I need it to be. The pencil also looks quite 'short', &amp; I'd assume one would go through this product extremely quickly.

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èGlossier 'Solar Paint' Luminous Bronzer Cr√®me - $20.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: High-End Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï These just look cool. I love a luminous bronzer, so I'm not one to shy away from that aspect. I've tried very minimal product from Glossier, so if I were to ever place an order with them - this is definitely a stand-out product that calls for my attention.

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èFlower Beauty 'Red Carpet Secret Eye Bright' Palette - $14 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Affordable Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï Everything about this just makes me dislike it ... especially the obnoxiously sizable price tag. I think the applicator would be terrible to apply a firmer cream product, &amp; even considering blending it out with that thing seems impossible. The amount of setting powder you get is quite insufficient granted how much under-eye powder I actually use. 

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èVDL 'Perfecting Last' Foundation - $20.10 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: K-Beauty Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï I've tried a lot of K-Beauty makeup, &amp; this brand is definitely amongst my favorite! Their products are so luxurious, it's inexplicable as to how they keep their prices so low. When I saw that they were releasing a new foundation, I was very excited! They use some absolute ground-breaking technologies in their products to really set the standard bar high. I can only imagine how much I would enjoy this product, &amp; I hope to add it to my collection one day!

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èViolet Voss 'Care Bears' Eyeshadow¬† Palette - $? 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: High-End Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï I've nothing against 'Care Bears' &amp; I actually think it makes a cute palette theme. My only bother with THIS palette, is that the interior color-story isn't really reminiscent of what one would expect by glancing at the palette's cover. Inside, it looks just like any other of Violet Voss's million rainbow eyeshadow palettes, &amp; definitely not suggestive to that of 'Care Bears'. There's just nothing exclusive to this palette that makes me want to buy it.

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èToo Faced 'Pomade in a Pencil' Brow Pencil - $23.00
 

‚û°Ô∏è Classification: High-End Makeup 


‚úÖ INSPIRED 


‚òï I've really been loving triangle-shaped brow pencils lately, &amp; the fact that this one is crafted of 'pomade' sounds captivating. I usually use both a pencil AND a pomade in my brows, so I wonder if this product would be a viable solution for me? I also wonder if it would be TOO soft &amp; creamy to shape any precision lines. So many questions, but I'd definitely give it a shot!

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èMorphe '35F Fall Into Fabulous' Artistry Palette - $26.00 


‚û°Ô∏è Classification: Affordable Makeup 


‚ùå TIRED 


‚òï Sometimes Morphe has really remarkable palettes that stand-out in an industry bogged down by palettes. However, this one just doesn't do it for me. It looks to have too many repetitive shades, &amp; I honestly believe it would make a great 9-pan. I'm sure the formula is nice, &amp; you can get a good many looks out of it - but it's unarguably NOT for me.

3060,Makeup,How to Clean Out a Lip Gloss Tube?,"Hello,

I have a couple of the old Urban Decay Pocket Rocket lip glosses from 2010. I would like to empty them of old product and put in a new lip gloss to use, as the packaging on these are cute. Is that possible? Any tips on how to empty them without destroying the component? Tips?

Thank you!"
3061,Makeup,setting spray or setting powder,"im planning on concealing my back tattoos to hide them, i know im supposed to use red color corrector since mine are only black and my skin color concealer on top. but for the final step would it be better to use setting spray or powder ?"
3062,Makeup,Any tips for under eye concealer for someone with red/pink cheeks?,"After years of playing with makeup, I‚Äôve decided foundation isn‚Äôt for me. Especially after moving to the desert. I really want to find a brightening concealer that‚Äôs 70%ish coverage though to make me look a little more polished. I can‚Äôt find a good shade match though because I have red/pink cheeks that I‚Äôm not looking to cover up. Any advice or product recommendations? Or will I not be able to conceal just my under eye without messing with my cheeks? Also, I have no idea my undertone, sometimes I see yellowish and sometimes I see pink."
3063,Makeup,I'm just kinda getting into make up and I'm looking for affordable decent brands I can experiment with (preferably lip gloss/eyeliner),I think my title sums it up. I don't do much mostly because u don't know how yet so just some nice lip glosses/liquid lipstick and eyeliner I can experiment with that's well relatively pigmented but if I mess up isn't to big a deal cost wise.... I like fun colors!! Like blues and purples but also want a few standard options as well I think I prefer more mat finish from what I've seen thus far but gloss is fun too

3067,Makeup,What are your shopping habits?,"Hey lovelies, I have a question for everybody: Which kind of store do you usually find yourself choosing when shopping for a makeup product/products?

1. The one where the price of the product is lower than in other shops, but you pay for shipping, OR
2. The one where the product is slightly more pricey but the store offers free shipping?"
3068,Makeup,Allergic reaction to a Tower 28 lip gloss ?,"I'd like to talk about something weird that happened today : I tried a Tower 28 lip gloss for the first time, and within seconds my lips felt numb, and I had a sensation of pins and needles, especially on my upper lip. 

The sensation went from ""wait, was this supposed to be plumping ?"" about a minute in, to not being able to talk properly, and needing to get this off my lips ASAP because it hurts, just 30ish secs later. After removing it, the numbness slowly faded, to be back to my normal sensations about 15mins later. I didn't see any swelling.

I'm confused because this type of reaction never happened to me before, I have no issues with my other lip glosses (at worst, I felt a slight tingling with the Fenty gloss bomb, and stopped using it). Plus the brand insists on their products being hypoallergenic, suited for sensitive skin, so I wasn't worried about allergens. I'm surprised at how intense my reaction was (and I'm on antihistamines, this is bizarre but I can't find another explanation than an allergy). I patch tested it on my had and in my elbow crease, nothing happened.

I looked up what could cause lip numbness but haven't found anything of note that could explain why the gloss did this. I compared Tower 28's formula composition to all the other glosses I've tried and had no issues with (Clarins, Roen, Pat McGrath, Lisa Eldridge, Too Faced, Urban Decay), and all I could identify as being different were the vegetal oils (apricot kernel oil, rice bran extract, rosemary leaf extract, rosa canina fruit oil, raspberry seed oil).

Has anyone had experienced a similar reaction, or have any insight on this ? I don't know what to think of this problem."
3069,Makeup,I need help with my eyebrows (guy),"I have brown hair but the tips of my eyebrows are very light which makes my eyebrow piercing look kinda weird. I've tried dying my eyebrows my hair color but they are still too light, should I try dying them darker than my hair or will that look even weirder?"
3070,Makeup,Help me please,"Hi guys so I‚Äôm new to makeup and have literally never ever used it however I have tried liquid eyeliner and honestly I can‚Äôt do it at all, I‚Äôve tried all the tips all the tutorials and I can‚Äôt seem to get it right. I‚Äôm blind in one eye,have shakey hands and hooded eyelids which honestly doesn‚Äôt help, does anyone have any advice??"

3073,Makeup,Tatcha Silk Powder Dupe?,"Hi! I‚Äôm trying out a sample of Tatcha Silk Powder and I really enjoy how lightweight, translucent, and natural it feels and looks on my skin. I‚Äôm thinking about buying some but I‚Äôve never bought powder before (I use makeup very lightly so I found it unnecessary) and I was wondering if there are any other similar ones that I should try before getting such an expensive one. Any suggestions?"
3074,Makeup,Help me make my eyebrows awesome,"I use minimal makeup (f) but feel very out together when I have my eyebrows done. Is a pencil best, or how do I make them look fabulous like so many chickas I see everywhere?"
3075,Makeup,Foundation Issues,"So I‚Äôm not big into makeup, my mom made me feel scandalous for wanting to wear it for school and did it for me if there was q formal event saying I had to wear it and would look bad without it so I never learned and now I just don‚Äôt have the patience. I do however wear a little bit here and there mostly foundation, lipstick, basic eyeliner, and mascara. 

My main issue is in foundation right now. I splurged a bit and bought NARS since it‚Äôs supposed to be good for dry skin and got it color matched at Ulta and everything but it‚Äôs too full coverage and ends up making me look fake and sickly since i don‚Äôt know how to contour or use blush. I started mixing it with a moisturizer to make it more sheer since it allows my natural red pigmentation to show and gives my face dimension but it starts like cracking and looking flakey despite being a liquid foundation. I use a primer and everything!

Should I try mixing it with something else or do I just need to cut my losses and try to find a new foundation with more buildable coverage? For reference the shade is mont blanc I have very dry skin except for my nose which is oily and I‚Äôm very red in the face.

Any help would be appreciated!!!"

This is a curated list (with reviews!) of my six most-loved, tried-and-true products from the month of July. 


Over the last month, I found myself repeatedly returning to these products, &amp; I wanted to share them with you!

......

üìå Touch in Sol 'Pretty Filter' Glassy Skin Balm 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I ALWAYS double-prime, &amp; for my first primer I tend to go with either a hydrating or illuminating formula. This one is a SUPERIOR hydrator. It feels sooo nice as I apply it to my face, that I actually crave putting this product on. It feels the best hydrating the under-eye area, &amp; you can feel an immediate difference in the texture of your skin. There is a slight fragrance to this, but I really like it &amp; find it refreshing. The cream itself is very soft, &amp; almost gel-like in texture.


üí∞ Price: $32 (Ulta)

......

üìå Physician's Formula 'Butter Believe It!' Foundation + Concealer 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I choose three foundations each month to use, &amp; NEVER would I have thought THIS would be the one that I liked so much! I love how it completely transforms my face &amp; covers up everything that I don't want to see - without feeling heavy or gross. Another benefit to this formula is that it doesn't BUDGE. It's very difficult to take off at the end of the day, which I kind of appreciate because it stays in place all day long. I love that it doubles as a concealer, so I get that demanded extra-coverage exactly where I need it. Also, this does have a strong tropical fragrance to it, but I don't mind it. It works extremely well with both a brush AND a dampened sponge. 


üï∂ Shade: Light-to-Medium

üí∞ Price: $11.99 (Ulta)

......

üìå No7 'Lift &amp; Luminate Triple Action' Finishing Powder
 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I ran out of my beloved Charlotte Tilbury mini powder, &amp; I've always heard that this was a dupe product for that finishing powder. Well, I even like it MORE than the Charlotte Tilbury! Just a fine layer of powder gently pressed under the eye creates an absolute blurred section. I was incredibly impressed the first time I used it, &amp; I couldn't believe the price difference! This finishing powder is an ABSOLUTE must-have in any makeup lover's collection. 


üï∂ Shade: Light/Medium

üí∞ Price: $10.77 (Amazon)

......

üìå Charlotte Tilbury Brow Set - 'Brow Cheat' Micro Precision Brow Pencil &amp; 'Legendary Brows' Micro Precision Tinted Brow Gel 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I just love everything about this duo. Together, these pieces create my perfect brow. The pencil is the PERFECT consistency, &amp; it's so easy to use as well as being comfortable in the hand. The shade is exactly what I look for in a brow pencil. I am able to create bold lines as well as simple strokes with the one unique tip. The brow gel, on-the-other-hand is the perfect set to my shape. The teensy brush allows me to get in between each brow hair &amp; shape them precisely where I want them. The color isn't overpowering, either. It's just enough to provide a slight ombre effect. If you are really into brows like me, you'd really enjoy this set! 


üï∂ Shade: Pencil = Natural Brown; Gel = Soft Brown

üí∞ Price: Duo = $48; Pencil = $25 ; Gel = $23

......

üìå Lip Duo - Lottie London 'Slay All Day' Lipliner &amp; Tower28 'ShineOn' Lip Jelly 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I always try new lip combinations every month, &amp; this was my find this month!! I love how this set creates the most-natural FULL, juicy lips - yet, it's so easy &amp; unchallenging. I use the pencil to line &amp; define only my cupid's bow area &amp; a small, bold line below my lower lip to create the illusion of fuller lips. The jelly gloss shade goes PERFECTLY with the lip liner shade &amp; really camouflages the application lines. I get a nice, solid wear time out of this combo, too! 


üï∂ Shade: Pencil = Fleek; Gloss = Coconut

üí∞ Price: Duo = $19; Pencil = $5 ; Gloss = $14

......

üìå Roma Laundry Detergent 


‚ñ™Ô∏è Why: I secretly enjoy doing laundry because I'm addicted to fragrant things - &amp; laundry is one of those areas where you can really discover some pretty interesting scents. I've always had my eye on this detergent, &amp; wondered how a $1 detergent would perform...&amp; well, it actually SHOCKED me. I am a dedicated powder-Tide person, &amp; I would choose this any day over powdered-Tide. It smells soooo good, &amp; cleans so well. I'm really happy I tested this hidden gem out. 


üí∞ Price: $1.12 (Walmart)

3082,Makeup,hello I'm a 17 year old trans girl with no experience with makeup and wanna try eye liner,"I know nothing about it 

is it worth getting cheap eye liner or should I spend a bit more I found this one on Amazon and it has good reviews but seems pretty cheap 

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0067VKMFO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_dl_WAGRFZD9AG83Y1XEWN0K

also should I get anything else with this or is it good on its own??"
3083,Makeup,Lit from within natural highlighter - Sephora credit to use,"Hello. Can anyone recommend a lit from within, natural highlighter (no glitter/obvious shimmer) that would work on textured skin. I just want to keep it very subtle for personal preference. I‚Äôm going to have a $90+ dollar in store credit at Sephora to use because I forgot to return some items within 30 days. 

I‚Äôve heard Nars may have something like this, but I find their blushes like orgasm to have too much glow. Not sure where to even begin. Alternately I‚Äôd be willing to try something drugstore just to dry out the look and use my credit on some dermalogica product or a few blurring powders I‚Äôve been wanting to try. 

PS. Please no Hourglass. Their baked and ambient powders have emphasized my pores in the past and I‚Äôm not willing to try their brand anymore in general. 

Thanks!!"
3084,Makeup,Makeup/No-Makeup look with skin hyperpigmentation?,"I have hyperpigmentation on my chin area. I would really like to know a good concealer that would give that no-makeup look finish. I don‚Äôt like wearing foundation, so a good concealer would be a must for me.

I would prefer a cream based concealer. But I‚Äôm not sure if a liquid would be best? Would I need like a primer or something else with it to make it stay? I don‚Äôt wear makeup usually so I wouldn‚Äôt know. I have oily skin by the end of the day btw."
3085,Makeup,30-something M trying to cover beard shadow; can I get some feedback/advice?,"Hi all! Probably not a surprise but I'm a still-figuring-it-out-gender-wise AMAB who has been feuding with my beard shadow, and I feel like I could use some help from people who know what they are talking about. My beard is dark, rough, and pervasive, and I have extremely oily skin. I've tried a number of things, but I feel like I'm still at auto-clocked status even to myself which makes me \*super\* dysphoric. I'm also a total newbie to makeup for the most part and am kind of having to learn it out as I go.

My current routine: 

* Shave
* Moisturizer
* Face primer (Rimmel Stay Matte)
* Corrector over mustache/goatee area (LA Girl Peach Corrector), set with powder
* Concealer (Maybelline Fit Me) over the corrected area, set with powder
* Foundation (Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless) over face, including corrected/concealed area

Am I going wrong on technique? Do I need different products for my face? How much of this is in my head vs . . .well, my face? 

I've put a few pictures into an Imgur album (multiple days, angles, lighting) for your consideration: [https://theprincessunknown.imgur.com/all](https://theprincessunknown.imgur.com/all). I could probably provide more if needed. Thank you so much for any help you can provide, it would be such a relief for me."
3086,Makeup,"Foundation, etc with hella freckles?","I wanna know what you guys recommend for foundation, concealer,  etc when you have lots of freckles and sweat easily. I feel like I can only do sheer coverage/more natural because if I go for full coverage it‚Äôll just look like a fail in a couple hours lol. Agree or disagree? Tips and tricks? Appreciate ya."
3087,Makeup,Is the Dior blush worth it?,"The dior blush has been getting a lot of hype now and I was wondering if all the hype is worth it. It looks great on people but I feel like it‚Äôs like any other regular blush, nothing too special. Has anyone personally tried it and found a difference in quality or something?"

3090,Makeup,Eyeliner for glasses,So I just started to do my makeup and noticed that whenever I put on eyeliner ( withought my glasses) it kinda warps when I put my glasses on. The eyeliner looks shorter and like scrunched in. For reference my prescription is like -10 in both eyes. What can I do to avoid this?
3091,Makeup,I left makeup sitting in a hot car for a week.. is it okay to continue using?,"I recently came back from a road trip and lost my makeup bag in the car (its a small pouch) 
I just found it but it's been in there for a week! I live in TX for it gets HOT. The products I had in there were lipsticks, eyeliner, mascara, foundation. 
Is it okay to still use? I would hate to have to throw everything out as some of the items were barely used.

The reason why I prefer liquid eyeliners in inkwell packaging over ones in pen or marker packaging, is because I had a NYX Epic Ink eyeliner, Physician Formula Eye Booster, Milani the Tank eyeliner, and Maybelline Curvitude eyeliner run out after 2 weeks. Yes, all four of then happen to dry out after 2 weeks each (weird). Whereas, inkwell eyeliners lasts months and even years for me. I also find them more easier to apply too.

3117,Makeup,I'm a fifteen year old girl and I need help with my foundation.,"I've been using makeup for about a year now and thanks to face masks, I've had a little bit of room for expirementation but with the new school year coming up and the possibility of no masks, I find myself stuck in a corner.

No matter what i do, my foundation doesn't cover up my blemishes. I tried both powder and liquid, brush and fingers. I am currently using a medium to full coverage liquid foundation that is mostly working. The problem is that as soon as I step out of my bathroom and into the sunlight, it's almost as if my foundation isn't there. The sun shows the truth: that my foundation is not working. My pimples, which aren't terrible but still prominent, show, along with my freckles, which I'm not to worried about, dark spots on my face, and my huge pores. Of course concealer helps but there is only so much that it can do. I've tried going super light (maybe it just didn't look natural with too much makeup) and I've tried putting on multiple layers. My skin is often oily so I use a mattifying primer. It is silicon based while my foundation is water based so I tried using a different primer but I get the same thing. No matter what I do, when I look at my mirror near my window, it's just terrible.

My skin isn't the best, although I've recently begun taking bigger steps to fix that. I moisturize, exfoliate, etc, but I am a teen and I don't have the ""perfect skin"" gene. The fact is that I've seen the way that foundation can cover up imperfections and I can't figure out how to do it for myself.

Is it just that the foundation isn't right for my skin? Or is there a different application that I haven't tried? Thanks for reading and I hope that someone can help."

They also faded away within like 20 mins of being on my arm without any activity happening.

Is there anything I can do to make the pigment better without applying so many layers my skin gets irritated? I have 3 other Colourpop palettes that I've had little to no issue with.

It almost looks like a black eye or something or like I had put black shadow under my eye. I don't normally rub my eyes, so I figured it was caused by my mascara being on my lower lash line. 

Today I didnt put any mascara on my lower lash line and still ended up with the smudges. It's basically on the portion where I'd put my concealer on my eye bags, so if I try and wipe it off I just would end up removing my concealer.

Has anyone had this happen before? It's obviously not caused by the lower lash line now so I'm kinda lost on how to fix this. Am I blinking too much or something??

Now I want to catch up and explore what I've been missing out on. From normal people on the street to you-tubers, makeup just seems so magical and really seems to elevate people's self esteem and mood.   
But I'm not 13 anymore and I don't really have the social permission to mess up my makeup and play around. If I come to work looking like a 6 year old loose in mom's lipstick, it hits a lot harder at this age.   


I took a minute to research and find out I'm a pink/blue undertone (different people call it different things?) and what colors work well with that as an introductory.  


I figured a BB cream or sheer foundation/sunscreen combo would be best for me to start with, so I got a bottle of Loreal's Infallible foundation in Cool Porcelain. I also grabbed a Burts Bees brown mascara and I already had a bottle of Lush's brown liquid eyeliner that I really like.   


I got in front of my bathroom mirror and tried my best. I feel like I look like Leatherface. Especially without my glasses, my face in the mirror looks alien. Inhuman. My partner says I look fine. Is this something I'll get over? Is looking at yourself in makeup and seeing YOU a skill you have to build? Or am I just doing something wrong? I don't think I'm putting on too much, but maybe not having blush is doing it?  


I appreciate any and all advice, and thank you for reading!"
3144,Makeup,looking for a consistency like maybelline fit me concealer,"i'm looking for a cream/foundation like maybelline fit me concealer (i tried the foundation and the colour doesn't match/mixing colours doesn't help either). i use it as a foundation right now and i love it! it gives a slight glow and looks like a medium coverage/natural, the only downside that i noticed is the short lasting time which is why i would be curious if you guys know a substitute like it x"
3145,Makeup,How long after a stye can I wear makeup again?,"Had a tiny stye for about 2-3 days, did black tea bags and it‚Äôs basically gone now. I wanted to wear makeup this weekend (after disinfecting and tossing some out ofc) 

How long after it heals can I wear makeup?"
3146,Makeup,Am I the only one who hates how lipstick looks on me?,My lips aren't thin and I'd say are slightly above average but everytime I wear lipstick I feel like it makes my lips look smaller. Aswell as whenever I wear it the skin around my lips looks yellow. The only lipstick that seems to look good on me is black and I only really wear that in the winter and it's not exactly an everyday lipstick.
3147,Makeup,Elf Cosmetics Order Not Going Through. Anyone Else?,"I have tried to place an order w/ e.l.f. three times, but customer service keeps saying the order ""could not be processed."" This last time they said use a different browser (I'm using Chrome). And it's not a problem with my card. Has anyone else had this happen to them? I'm trying to order products I can only find on their site, otherwise I'd just give up and try ordering somewhere else. Just wondering if this has been a problem for anyone else."
3148,Makeup,Wearing makeup as a male in University ?,"I am contemplating and planning to wear makeup university , at 20 years old ...


What I'm looking to cover are some strange patches of dry , red and flaky skin that I don't enjoy seeing 


Would it be acceptable in a university setting where are only 18+ years old students ?



**I tried it once (at driving lessons , no one noticed) and I loved it so much that I'm thinking to buy more foundation , concealer and primer and perhaps a bit of bronzer for a tad of contouring 






Did anyone try this ? I know that I may be the oddity of the class , but I take it as wearing clothing tbh due to my face"
3149,Makeup,fear about starting,"i was never allowed to wear makeup growing up, and despite being 18, i still fear that i‚Äôll be criticized for wearing it, or for putting in effort to appear attractive. i know that virtually everyone wears it, and it‚Äôs such a fun thing to do, i love putting it on when i‚Äôm by myself, it‚Äôs such an art form to me. i love what makeup can do.
but again, i feel so shameful for wearing it. and i‚Äôm afraid that if i wear it in public, i‚Äôll look stupid or do it completely wrong. but oh i want to. i‚Äôm going to college and id love to start trying it out, so what are some ways to kinda ease myself into wearing it somewhat regularly/casually? i mostly want to emphasize my eyes, im not overly concerned about contour etc"
3150,Makeup,Is $80-90 a fair price for a makeup haul?,"Hi, I'm new to makeup and most of the products I'm buying are drugstore or from Amazon."
3151,Makeup,How can I apply coconut oil to my eyelashes without it leaking down to my eyes?,"I have no experience with make up but I recently decided I wanted to make my eyelashes and eyebrows look prettier by applying coconut oil to them. My eyebrows have been going great so far but I can‚Äôt apply the oil to my eyelashes without it dripping down to my eyes, causing them to sting and making my eyes do blurry for a while, no matter how carefully I try to do it. How can I be sure it won‚Äôt get into my eyes again?"
3152,Makeup,How do the Iconic Light lashes hold up from house of lashes?,"I have been recommended to try the iconic light lashes for a while for my eye shape, but they are very expensive so I was wondering how many wears you have gotten out of them for those who have tried them? Is it worth it?"
3153,Makeup,Advice for well-loved eyeliner,"I've been using the Stila eyeliner for several months now, and I love it. However, it's gotten to the point where the tip is a bit soft and doesn't carry pigment anymore, so that I can still use the eyeliner but I can't get a sharp wing anymore. It's kind of like the issue I've had with brush pens and drawing, and with those when I wear out the tip I just buy a new one. Should I do the same here? It's kind of an expensive liner, but I only ever use it for wings and it still has lots of pigment left. are there any good (cheaper) alternatives that are good for wings in the meantime until Ulta has another sale? Or is there anything I can do for the liner right now to ""wake it up"" again?"
3154,Makeup,false lashes coming off - due to glasses?,"Hi all, I saw that there was one other post on here about lashes and glasses (the advice was to trim them and wear them) but I have a bit of a different dilemma. 

I went to a makeup trial last week (I'm getting married in a few weeks) and had false lashes put on for the first time ever. My eyes teared up nonstop but I eventually got used to it. 

The problem then was that they started coming off near my inner half of the eyes after an hour or two. My MUA blamed my glasses for them and said they would just come off like that because I was wearing glasses??? I don't know how this is possible but I wanted your advice on whether I should still give them a shot but have her put separate sections or just press them down whenever they come off throughout the wedding day."

‚ú¥ TOP 5 Favorites - Lip Gloss

......

‚û°Ô∏è NOTE: This is MY opinion &amp; experience; regarding product quality. As always, use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

I'm sure it comes as no surprise, but I'm a makeup collector. I collect makeup products of all sorts! 


For this series, I really want to hone in on the products in my collection (by category) that have truly stood out to me, &amp; ones that I keep returning to over-and-over again. 


For this first installment, I thought it would be fun to start with lip gloss. Lip gloss is something that I use every single day - regardless if I'm wearing makeup or not. 


For me, there are certain attributes of a lip gloss which can define it as 'good' or 'bad' -¬† 


I have heavily lined lips, so I need a gloss to automatically 'juice' up my lips &amp; camouflage those lines! The scent is another factor; I prefer a sweetly scented gloss. Lastly, I look for glosses that provide a sheer wash of color with a slight glimmer to them in order to reflect light. 


Please read on below to check-out my TOP 5 most-favorite (in order from least to greatest) lip glosses in my entire collection &amp; why: 

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èLip Gloss #5 - Bobbi Brown - 'Crushed Oil-Infused' Gloss

+ Color Description: sheer brown

+ Applicator: small paddle

+ Shade: 'Free Spirit'

+ Scent: oranges

+ Price: $29 (Ulta)

+ Comments: I just love how this gloss pairs with any lip liner. It is also so incredibly cushiony &amp; comfortable on the lips.

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èLip Gloss #4 - Milani Cosmetics - 'Keep it Full' Nourishing Lip Plumper

+ Color Description: sheer pink w/ gold shimmer

+ Applicator: large doefoot

+ Shade: '04 Luminoso'

+ Scent: peppermint

+ Price: $9 (Ulta)

+ Comments: this does not feel like a plumping gloss at all - it's very mild. I use this so much that I'm almost out of this tube &amp; really need to pick up another replacement!

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èLip Gloss #3 - Fenty Beauty - 'Gloss Bomb' Universal Lip Luminizer

+ Color Description: sheer pink w/ shimmer

+ Applicator: large doefoot 

+ Shade: 'Fu$$y'

+ Scent: fruit punch kool-aid packet

+ Price: $19 (Sephora)

+ Comments: I don't wear this a whole lot, because it's expensive &amp; I save it for best. When I'm going on a date, or going to a party, this is what I reach for. I love it ESPECIALLY because of its unique scent, it smells great!

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èLip Gloss #2 - Gigi Gorgeous Cosmetics - 'Less is More' Lip Gloss

+ Color Description: sheer pink w/ silver shimmer

+ Applicator: large doefoot

+ Shade: 'Get Into It'

+ Scent: cupcakes

+ Price: $4 (Amazon)

+ Comments: Oddly, this is one of my favorites! I bought it resale because I've always loved Gigi &amp; wanted to try her makeup. This certainly did not disappoint. 

......

‚ñ™Ô∏èLip Gloss #1 - ShopMisu - 'IXIA' Lip Gloss

+ Color Description: sheer red tint w/ multicolored glitter particles

+ Applicator: large doefoot 

+ Shade: 'IXIA'

+ Scent: cinnamon bubblegum

+ Price: ? (they are bringing it back soon)

+ Comments: my absolute favorite! I love how this catches the light &amp; makes my lips look so good! It pairs well with any liner, &amp; is perfect when your lips are dry.

Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to look myself in the mirror and try to say I‚Äôm beautiful, but I have never been one to use makeup to uplift my looks. Am I weird? Am I just doing it wrong? I have so many questions‚Ä¶"

3167,Makeup,What kind of eyeliner won't make my eyes water and my nose run all day long?,"I have a question I want to ask about makeup, specifically eyeliner, but I have some things to explain first. Not that I think this will matter much, I'll say it anyway, I am a guy, not a girl.

I suffer from what is known as seasonal allergies, unfortunately the allergens that I react to include things that are in the air all year long, so I suffer all year long.

I'm allergic to dust mites, mold (both indoor and outdoor types), several grasses, several weeds, oak trees, pine trees, and cedar trees.

As you can see it's quite a bit, I was allergic to about 75% of the environmental allergens they tested me for. Since I'm allergic to so much, I now have to administer immunotherapy allergy injections to myself every week.

I'm not sure what it is in some eyeliners that cause my eyes to water and my nose to run like they do, but I really like to wear eye makeup because thanks to the allergies I also have massive dark circles under my eyes that I try to cover up, or I would like to try to use it to my advantage with some mild smoky eyes to add mystery.

But I only ever used one waterproof eyeliner that didn't make my eyes water and my nose run, it was by Almay but it's been discontinued.

I read online that any waterproof eyeliner is likely to cause an allergic reaction because of the oil base that makes it waterproof. 

But I was hoping surely someone out there has had experience, or used, or knows of some waterproof eyeliner that I can put on my waterline that won't cause my nose to run like a dripping faucet, or my eyes to water so profusely.

Help me, please?"
3168,Makeup,Mac concealer alternative?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm looking for a new concealer. I have been using Mac's Pro Longwear concealer since I first started using makeup years ago. I want to switch to a new product that is cruelty free.

My university will be reopening soon and makeup that is heavy or detectable is not permitted on campus and over the past year I've developed a habit of applying mascara when I get ready for the day and can't do without as I feel ""empty"" without it. (Talk about mascara addiction! Lol) So I'm looking for a mascara that looks natural and won't clump as I have fairly long lashes and most of the mascaras that I use tend to weigh down my lashes and clump at the roots. And I would also like some suggestions for light/medium coverage foundations that contains spf and has a broad shade range!

3202,Makeup,Suggestions for medium/buildable coverage foundation that won't stick to beard...,"Hi!

I had rosacea really bad as a kid and in my early 20's started wearing foundation to help mask some of the redness.  The rosacea is much more under control and rarely flares up, but I still wear foundation to even out my face.  (I'm 38 now)

I used to use Revlon Colorstay liquid, but looked for something lighter/more natural and ended up with Physicians formula CC cream.  I really like it - it provides enough sheer coverage that if needed i could use some colorstay powder over.  


I always wear ""shortish stubble"" (usually a number 3 on my beard trimmer) on my face and neck.  Now that i'm getting older, the hair on my face is getting lighter and or white in spots.  So now, these liquid makeups are really sticking to it and you can really notice it - it doesn't look so great anymore.  My whole goal is just inconspicous.  

I read online that maybe mineral foundations would be good - and not stick to the beard as much.

Does anyone have this issue and found something that works or can reccommend some products?

Thanks!"

They make my eyelashes clump together into a few scary mega lashes and they leave big chunks of mascara behind. I never have this problem with drugstore mascaras, only the supposedly ‚Äúnicer‚Äù brands. Why does this happen to me? Am I doing something wrong? I try to scrape the excess/chunks off the wand before I apply, I‚Äôve tried soaking the bottom of the tubes in warm water first to loosen it up a bit, nothing works and now I have a bunch of mascaras that I seemingly can‚Äôt use"
3207,Makeup,is it ok to use mascara for other stuff rather than just my eyelashes?,"i do this look where I put mascara absolutely everywhere, is it healthy/will it give me acne or some shi, or am I ok???"
3208,Makeup,Waterproof dupe for MAC In Extreme Dimension 3D Black Lash Mascara,"I got a sample of the In Extreme Dimension mascara a couple years ago and love how natural but fluffy/fluttery it makes my lashes (which are naturally short and sparse). 
However, I can‚Äôt wear it if it‚Äôs cold or humid out bc seems to run like crazy. I‚Äôve heard the waterproof version is a completely different formula so I don‚Äôt want to spend the money on it without knowing for sure.. 
Does anyone have experience with both? Or can recommend a mascara like the original that‚Äôs actually waterproof or at least more water resistant? Thanks!"
3209,Makeup,Has anyone made diy shimmering body/face mist?,What recipe did you use? How did it turn out? Would you do it again?
3210,Makeup,Budget friendly eyeshadow brushes/sets?,"Hello,

I've been using these two brush sets from Amazon and they really are worth $8-$10. After the first wash, they couldn't reform like before and have started wiggling in metal clip. I LOVED Lamora because they put an inscription on each brush, of what the use of brush is.

I'm fine with spending $20-$30 on an entire eye brush set. I saw some on BHcosmetics and have had many makeup enthusiasts swear by them. If you're one of those people, which set would you recommend?

Also, I'm looking to buy eyeliner brushes for my creme/gel eyeliner pods I have from Colourpop. What type of brush should I buy for them?

Thank you in advance. :)"

3213,Makeup,"What are your favorite products for super dry, super acne prone skin?","Hi guys, I‚Äôm new here and I really need advice. I know that makeup is only as good as the skin it‚Äôs applied to, so I‚Äôm currently trying to get that under control. I‚Äôve only recently begun dealing with adult acne which I think was triggered by going off a medication. 

I‚Äôm mainly looking for a good primer, foundation (any coverage,) translucent powder, and concealer. Everything looks either too matte or too wet on my skin, and most things draw attention to my acne. I can deal with texture but I just want to hide as many red spots and as much dryness as possible. 

I‚Äôm open to both drugstore and higher end products, I‚Äôm just desperate at this point and tired of all the fine lines and dry patches. :-("

3215,Makeup,Does anyone else with dry skin not powder their face?,"I have dry skin. I‚Äôve really liked the Too Face Born This Way foundation. I‚Äôll lightly use a powder brush with the Maybelline translucent powder. But I still feel like my makeup gets a little crusty during the day and I feel like that my foundation looks better if I don‚Äôt powder. Is this normal? Does anyone else not powder? Or do you need something to ‚Äúset‚Äù the foundation?

I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to make my foundation look the best! TIA"
