16,Perfumes,Purchases from this last year that actually let me down (f),"
Calvin Klein Eternity Now: blind buy, purchased this in January, based on different reviews stating it was one of the best Eternity flankers, and at the very beginning, I really liked it. I actually used it just 3/4 times. It is fresh and easy, pleasant‚Ä¶but there is something a bit too sharp that makes me tired. I guess it is just okay, and it was quite cheap. Okay for daily use, nothing too impressive. Smells nice, but not amazing. Don‚Äôt find myself reaching for it, sadly. 5.5/10

Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau So Fresh: okay, I was obsessed with this for a while. Super obsessed. Even dreamed of it when I was still doubting about purchasing it or not (it was not a blind buy). Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think it‚Äôs is super nice, but maybe I was expecting to get more of it, to find it much more addictive, and actually, never got any compliment on it. On the skin it doesn‚Äôt last much either. It‚Äôs nice, but not that nice. Will keep using it. I may change my mind, but as of now: 7,5/10.

Zara Rose Gourmand: blind buy. Apparently it is a great dupe for Roses Vanille. Okay: lasting power it‚Äôs amazing, pleasant scent, and quite unique (at least where I live). But I NEVER find a good time/occasion to use it. Very strong for the summer, very heavy for work, a bit too mature for my age, maybe for clubbing layered with something lighter? But I like this to smell this from time to time. 7/10

Carolina Herrera CH 212: meh. I thought I was gonna love this and feel super confident while using it. Used it, and‚Ä¶ that was it. It turns annoying at some point, maybe because of the cactus. 6/10

Rituals Rituals of Amsterdam: wanted to get it so so bad, as I loved the shower foam. And the smell is great, fresh, orange-flowery, comforting. But lasting power? Excuse me? Maybe a bit more on clothes, but on the skin, it was a big let down. Not worth the price. You can find better Zara cheapies. But the bottle is gorgeous. Scent: 7.5-8/10. Performance: 4/10"

27,Perfumes,I sampled the Maison Margiela Replica scents and here are my thoughts,"[Here‚Äôs a picture of the sample set I got from Flaconi](https://imgur.com/a/7le53kc)

I got married on July 21 and have been on a quest to find my wedding scent. Spoiler alert: It wasn‚Äôt one of these. But I still tried them all and wrote down my thoughts.

by the fireplace (3/5)
opening: a bit harsh, woody and smoky
1 hour later: smells better a bit more creamier and like spicy nuts instead of smoke, would prefer this on a man though 
3 hours later: can barely smell it anymore , smells like powder/vanilla 

coffee break (4/5)
opening: hint of a coffee smell, mostly lavender
after 1 hour: creamy and lactonic lavender, sadly can‚Äôt smell any coffee
still able to smell it after 6+ hours

under the lemon trees (2/5)
opening: a little woody, zesty lime smell
fades into a clean soft lime scent
smells nice, but nothing special 
3 hours later: can still smell it, but barely. faded lime scent

lazy sunday morning (1/5)
opening: smells like laundry detergent with a hint of lemon and white florals, fresh and musky
smells too ‚Äúclean‚Äù for me
lasts about 4 hours though 

springtime in a park (2/5)
opening: musky floral, smells like an expensive but generic cherry blossom bodylotion 
my husband likes this one most so far 
it lasts a few hours, smells like Ritual of Sakura by Rituals 

bubble bath (2/5)
opening: soft and clean, a mild soap scent with florals 
very innocent and calming, comfortable day at home or office scent 
smells a bit more like musk and coconut after a few minutes, also like laundry detergent with less lime 
lasts about 4 hours, at the end it only smells like vanilla

beach walk (3/5)
opening: coconut, something floral too, light and warm, benzoin is slightly there 
lasts longish (4 hours), becomes vanilla-like scent after a while

sailing day (0/5)
okay this just smells off - really awful, had to scrub it off. I don‚Äôt know what it is about this, but I hate it. I‚Äôm sorry to everyone who likes this, but it‚Äôs not for me

jazz club (4/5)
opening: smells like my husbands shirt when he wears cologne, with a hint of booze/smoke 
too ‚Äúmanly‚Äù for my taste, wouldn‚Äôt wear this personally but I‚Äôll give it to my husband 

autumn vibes (1/5)
smells like a mix of jazz club and by the fireplace, smokey and sadly not woody 
lasts longer than most of the replica scents on me (5 hours)
not how I‚Äôd describe autumn to smell like 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

final thoughts:
- I can see myself wearing By the fireplace, Coffee Break and Beach Walk
- I hate to say this but the longevity of those is bad, especially for that price
- some of these scents smell great in the opening and then fade to a generic scent, mostly like a vanilla lotion. I love vanilla so it‚Äôs ok for me, but I expected more for the price (and also that‚Äôs not the purpose of wearing these fragrances)
- I can realistically see myself purchase Coffee Break (maybe even By the Fireplace) but I think there are better fragrances for a much better price 

overall I‚Äôm glad I tried them all and I‚Äôd highly recommend getting a sample set like this if you‚Äôre interested in the Replica scents.

In case anyone is interested, I used R√™ve de Hanami by Rituals on my wedding day, which still remains my husbands favorite :)

Also if someone knows a similar scent to Coffee Break that smells more like actual coffee, please let me know"

I have attempted multiple Google Searches with various spellings, Half typed entries in hoping Google would fill in the blank, etc‚Ä¶All to no avail.

So, I decided that Reddit in its infinite wisdom &amp; User Forums (Y‚Äôall!üòâüëçüèª), might be of more help, since it is a topic which each of You are obviously passion about &amp; much more familiar with than myself.

I unfortunately do not have any more information other than the way the person (a female) pronounced the name, when speaking about the fragrance she wore, and received positive comments about when wearing. It was a random video I can not relocate, so I am unable to contact that person directly and ask which fragrance it was she referred to in her video.
I apologize in advance for being so vague, but I have no other information to go on to give you.

91,Perfumes,DS and Durga - I Don‚Äôt Know What Review,"I recently got my hands on a sample of DS and Durga‚Äôs I Don‚Äôt Know What fragrance enhancer and it is blowing my mind. The main ‚Äúnotes‚Äù are iso e super, ambrox super, and a top note of bergamot. I would swim in this stuff if I could afford it (50 mL is $190) but luckily I only need one spray per day - it has insane longevity and moderate sillage. 

Their website describes it as ‚ÄúIt is like a building with only structure‚Äîno interior. You can fill in the interior with an oil, a scent you like, even an old scent that has lost its way. IDKW is built to layer and enhance everything else it touches.‚Äù

And the site goes on to describe iso e super as ‚ÄúWarm and ambery like patchouli with all trace of its aromatic profile sucked out‚Äù, which is exactly what I am getting. It is so fun and sexy and mysterious - very unisex but not particularly femme or masc. I love the general experience of patchouli but have always found it too cloying to wear due to the intensely identifiable aroma and hippie association (lol). I would wear I Don‚Äôt Know What on its own as an everyday scent if I had the full bottle.

I layered it on top of DS and Durga‚Äôs Rose Atlantic and it made the perfume explode in such a beautiful way. Typically Rose Atlantic has very weak longevity on me, but I can smell it many hours later with I Don‚Äôt Know What on top. Rose Atlantic is much more subtle, a waxy sea salt rose scent. A gorgeous modern rose scent if you‚Äôre looking for one.

What perfumes have you come across that are specifically for layering? Have you enjoyed them?"
92,Perfumes,The most unexpected compliment.,"Today I got into the elevator during my lunch break &amp; I saw a 10/10 getting in the lift with me. I knew straight off that she is way out of my league so i decided not to make a move.

I was walking away from the lift as we got down, Suddenly heard the sound of a pair of heels trotting towards me really fast. She was like 

‚Äú Excuse me Hi I‚Äôm ___ , we were in the lift together and your perfume literally made me go crazy. I feel like it just tapped into my animal instinct, what is it your wearing? ‚Äú

I did NOT expect that! Because the way she spoke to me, She was acting like she was hungry for me. I did tell her the name of the perfume and we exchanged numbers. 

After all this happened I was like ‚ÄúWoah!‚Äù What did I just hear. She literally made my day,

I know this scent not for everyone plus I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a modern day fragrance. But I feel like the ‚ÄúChanel Egoiste‚Äù is a mysterious masterpiece. 

What‚Äôs the best compliment you ever got?"

95,Perfumes,My review for Arsenico by V Canto,
96,Perfumes,#SOTD Arsenico by V Canto,
97,Perfumes,#SOTD Arsenico by V Canto,"Arsenico is a beautiful unisex fragrance which includes some interesting notes that are working amazingly good together and surprised me in a good way.

Top notes- calabrian bergamot, red currant, apple and pineapple.  
Middle notes- red patchouli, birch, jasmine, tonka bean, benzoin, cedar and artemisia  
Base notes- amber grey, moss and musk

This beautiful creation opens up with a graceful citrusy bouquet which is guided by calabrian bergamot and slowly becomes sweet thanks to the red fruits. All of this beauty flows to a woody vibe with some red patchouli, cedar and tonka bean which are all emraced by the jasmine and benzoin. This fragrance, with its incredible persistent trail is so long lasting because its true strength is found in grey amber, blended with ancient musk and precious mosses.  
Lovely!!! 

I tried it a few years ago and didn't feel it was right for me. But today, after I grew up a bit, I feel like I now realize what I have been missing. It's such a gorgeous fragrance, so mature and so elegant. Today I know that sometimes we need to give the fragrances the time they need :)"

109,Perfumes,Looking for something inexpensive that will make me smell like straight up coconut,"I love the smell of coconuts. I absolutely despise the taste and texture of them, but for some reason it‚Äôs probably my favorite smell on the planet. I love smelling like coconut, but purely coconut smelling fragrances are oddly hard to come by. I‚Äôve found plenty of things with notes of coconut, but it‚Äôs always either extremely faint or overpowered by something else, like vanilla or some kind of fruit or god forbid that awful artificial ‚Äúbeach wind‚Äù smell that lights my nostrils on fire. I‚Äôm autistic and have pretty severe sensory processing disorder so I tend to be ridiculously sensitive to smells, so anything unpleasant or sharp mixed into the coconut smell kinda ruins it for me, and I also have an aversion to feeling greasy or oily so straight up coconut oil doesn‚Äôt work either. Is there any generally inexpensive product (like &lt;$30, it doesn‚Äôt need to be anything fancy), be it perfume, cologne, body wash, body spray, conditioner, etc. that just smells like coconut and smells strongly of it too? So far the best thing I‚Äôve found is the coco loco from lush usa, but I go through them so fast and the scent doesn‚Äôt last super long."

Kvd Sinner. Again . Trashy . Powdery goth whore . 

Ariana Grande cloud . People say it‚Äôs a dupe for baccarat whatever . I wouldn‚Äôt know because I‚Äôm a cheap whore but I love this . It‚Äôs warm and sweet but not syrupy . Very enticing and the lasting and projection is amazing for about $20. Love

Korres Vanilla Freesia. Yes . Love vanilla so this is biased but everything else worked the litchi in the opening. The warmth of the patchouli &amp; musk.

I would say out of all of the Delinas, I much prefer La Rosee, with the OG Delina coming in at a close second but not quite FBW to me. I actually found Delina Exclusiv to be repulsive, I guess it may be the amber note that's more prominent in the dry down since  I generally do not like anything with an amber note.  I like Meloria a lot but I've heard that there's a cheaper 'dupe' so, I'm on the fence about getting a full bottle of it. 

Unsure why Meloria retails for slightly more on PdM's website for the same size bottle, it actually has slightly worse longevity on my skin compared to La Rosee.

It smells wonderful on my skin, but I feel that no one can smell it unless they‚Äôre sniffing my arm or neck (and well, that‚Äôs a little too close for most people). Ha! 

I‚Äôve been searching for a signature perfume that smells the same but gives a more moderate sillage. There are tons of Amber options out there, but a lot I‚Äôve tried smell too powdery. Powdery florals smell too mature to me, like an elderly woman‚Äôs fragrance so I avoid those.

I'm new to the world of perfumery and looking for a bit of advice.

I'm using two essential oils and one fragrance oil and am close to finding the perfect balance of the three for the smell I want.

I'm using perfumer's alcohol from Vetiver. I follow the 80/20 ratio and filling 10ml bottles with 8ml of alcohol and 2ml of oils.

40% top note, 50% middle note, 10% base note.

Here's the issue I'm experiencing and don't think it's normal.

When I attempt so spray the bottle, I have to put a lot of pressure on the top when pushing down. I feel like it shouldn't take so much, and I did something wrong. My alcohol supplier states on the site that adding water isn't necessary with the product I'm using.

I don't have any issues with the bottles before adding the perfume. What are you guys' thoughts?

Edit: Please if my alcohol to oil ratios are off let me know. Using 12 drops for top note, 20 drops for mid and 8 drops for base. That's the 2ml with 8ml alcohol for my 10ml bottles."

It was a small short, square , glass bottle‚Ä¶ similar to the photo. But this perfume was purple. I thought it was YSL Mon Paris when I smelled it, but learned it didn‚Äôt come out until 2016. 

It is VERY similar to Mon Paris, but instead of the floral notes, it had a scent I can only describe as dreamy‚Ä¶ like make your soul melt kind of smell. Maybe marshmallow? It‚Äôs a fruity, dreamy smell. She said her boyfriend told her it was like $300 (I‚Äôm not sure how true that really is.) Does any of this ring a bell? It‚Äôs been so long and I‚Äôm desperate! Lol"

221,Perfumes,Help IDing Perfume Sample,"I made a Sephora Canada order on June 12th. I added two sample perfumes to my order, Bitter Peach by TF and the one I'm trying to identify. I gave both to my sister. She said ""I love the sandalwood one"" like a week later, so I'm assuming that's in the name or it came with a list of scent notes where it was prominent.

My issue is, I'm looking back in my order history and the TF perfume has been changed, so I think the other sample was to (since the app is recognizing the offer rather than the specific listing).

Does anyone know which sample it could have been? Searching the app for ""sandalwood"" is popping up the NEST New York fragrance. Was that a sample in June?"

I am new to perfumes and looking for a signature scent that is light enough that I can wear to the office and not exude scent. I really loved Marc Jacobs Dot but that's discontinued now.

If raspberry/red berries is too hard to come by, I also love mango and gardenia. 

I would rather it be more inexpensive, and indie scents are fine as well. If you can get them at Sephora even better because I can hopefully sample a few!

253,Perfumes,Does anyone know FragWorld?,"A good friend of mine started being a consultant in a Multi-Level-Marketing Company located in italy. The company sells perfumes and other beauty products.

I got sceptical as the company (or my friend as a consultant) stated, that all big fragrance companies (dior, chanel etc) buy their essences for their perfumes at 'fragworld' who is the world leading corporation for perfume essences. 

Dior, Chanel etc are buying the essences via fragworld. The italian company buys the same essence for their perfumes. Their perfumes also don't contain water and are waaay better than the originals but much cheaper....

As I didn't found any site or documents that tells me the ingredients I started to search for fragworld.

Fragworld is located in france but their website doesn't work and the phone number isn't even registered. Also they aren't registered at the commercial register.  (Fragworld is listed as a company handling propery at another city)

Am I missing something? 'World leading company for perfume essences' ... but there is no evidence.

Would Dior and Chanel even buy their essences somewhere else? I don't have a clue about perfumes.

It's just very scetchy this italian company, selling products without an ingredient list, insisting their perfumes are better than the pricy originals etc.

What do you guys think of this?

Thanks :)"

285,Perfumes,Fragrance Minimalism- How Many Perfumes do You Really Need?,"Whether you‚Äôre a dude or dudette who loves fragrances but prefers not to get engulfed by rampant consumeristic practices, it is good to know that you only need a few bottles in your rotation. So how many do you really need? My magic number is 3.

**The All-Arounder**

This type of fragrance can be worn in multiple (if not all) situations, places, and weather conditions. My personal preference for an all-arounder usually falls under the fresh or fresh spicy category. The fragrance is inoffensive, likable, and easy to wear. You may or may not receive compliments while wearing it but you know you won‚Äôt choke out people either if you find yourself in enclosed spaces such as elevators, trains, and cramped conference rooms.

Suggestions: Tonic for Men/ Eau de Vie for women

**The Show-Stopper**

Among other things, fragrances are meant to give a person a strong sense of self and project self-confidence. Show-stoppers are incredibly memorable scents that set you apart from the crowd. You‚Äôd do well with choosing unique accords or notes that are less mainstream. This would mean your fragrance may not be as mass-appealing as your all-arounder, so you can expect people to either absolutely hate it or love it.

Suggestions: Priv√© Portrait of a Gentleman/Priv√© Amore Silenzioso (unisex)/Saffron Haze/Oui Mademoiselle

**The Skin Scent**

Okay, hear me out. Although seemingly counterintuitive, having a skin-scent type of fragrance in your small rotation is actually a useful option to have. Certain fragrances are designed to specifically enhance your natural smell. The concept of ‚ÄúYou-but-better‚Äù scents can work well, provided that the perfumer can execute the formulation well and use the right notes that can actually enhance a person‚Äôs unique personal aroma.

Suggestion: Nude Extrait de Parfum

Fragrance minimalism does not have to take away from your love of scents. In fact, it allows you to have a more intimate olfactory experience the way you never have before due to having too many fragrances in your collection."

287,Perfumes,Abbott NYC- Please Read,"I fell in love with Cape and have been slowly trying out other scents. I have ordered from Sephora bc of points and their return policy. However Sephora does not have one scent I wanted to try so I ordered a new scent directly from the Abbott website and a small size of the scent Sephora does not carry. All arrived and the scent Voyageurs which I ordered in the small size had a very odd scent, it dries down to smell like fuel, an almost gasoline scent. 

I wrote Abbott per their refund policy stating such and I'd like to return it for a refund. The owner (?) Michael Pass emailed me back and said they could only refund me 50%. Website says full refund for defective product so I push back. He emails me back in an unhinged manor and makes claims I'm a conspiracy theorist and snarkily adds I've insulted their perfumes. What in the world?

In my email I highly complimented their perfumes and raved about the other scents I have and said I loved the other scent I received but Voyageurs dried down in a very unpleasant fuel-smelling way. 

They did refund me, but Michael Pass and his insane customer service has put me off Abbott forever. There was more malarkey to the entire story but I don't have proof of it so I won't go in to it.

Lastly, just a heads up. The company is branded as Abbott NYC but they're based out of Texas now. A lot of people learned why bussinesses move to TX after Elon Musk moved Tesla as he wasn't able to legally exploit his workforce in California."

But now i need a break from both of them and i realised that i do not own a unique fruity or floral perfume yet or found any that i like because i despise floral. But i really do want to like it.

Do you have any designer perfume reccomendations based on this info?"

I can't find a photo of the bottle and I don't remember the name (so helpful, I know).

I remember it was a clear glass bottle, almost the size of a wine bottle. Similar in shape but had a flat top and some type of cork like cap. The perfume itself was clear or basically clear with no color. I specifically remember a white label with calla lillies on it. 

For reference. We're in the US.  I remember her having it in the late 90s and/or early 2000s. She definitely no longer had it past 2008 or so. 

I remember sniffing it all the time and stealing dabs of it from her. It may have been discontinued. It could've also been a wedding present and if that's the case, it may be from the mid to late 80s.  My mom no longer remembers it so the wedding idea is just that.

401,Perfumes,My budget scent finds,"I was just mentioning on here about a budget perfume that I am in love with. I have to add a couple to it:

1. Fancy (Jessica Simpson). It smells more ""grown-up"" than I expected &amp; it wears differently depending on the weather. It does well on me in the hot/humid summer weather. Fragrance is s said to be composed of sweet/fruity/caramel/vanilla/powdery/almond/white floral/fresh/nutty/amber. I get Caramel/Vanilla/Powder/Floral. 
2. Fantasy Intimate (Britney Spears). I don't know how these young gals are doing it but they are doing it well! This one is weirdly good one day and just nice the next. When it's good, it is not as flattering on me as Fancy but it's ""grown-up"" and  I get more of the musky and ozonic from the supposed accords of vanilla/sweet/musky/powdery/ozonic/citrus/fresh/fruity/white floral/amber
3. Egyptian Goddess (Auric Blends). It's an oil and it works better for me with fresh-from-the-shower skin or at bedtime. It's hard to describe but it's SO nice. It has all the ""main accords"" of powdery/musky/floral and is super soft, depending on how and where you apply it. If I apply just a bit to my wrists and throat, it's quiet and soft. If I want stronger projection, I also apply it to my bosom and right at the outside of my armpits. I only get the vanilla and musk with just enough floral to make the musk more feminine. This oil is a better one on me than the Kuumba Made Amber Paste that I like so much.

Now, realize that these will probably smell nicer and last longer on younger skin. I am 61 and no longer have the body great chemistry for fragrances. They tend to fade faster and not project as well as when I was under 50. (My mama did NOT tell me this about aging!)

The Fanny and Fantasy scents cost me under $20 each. Goddess was around $12.  I think that I sometimes get caught up in thinking price = better. I spent $30 on a small roller of The Only One and... it's a dud on me. It works really well, thank goodness if I layer it with the Egyptian Goddess or even Kuumba Made's Amber Paste. 

I also have turned my nose up at some celebrity scents but no longer. I have already asked for (and am waiting to receive) a bottle of Mariah Carey's Dreams, which sounds like it has my favorite notes in it.

 I also like the  Vanilla Bourbon from Mix:Bar but the perfume is no stronger or longer-lasting than the cheaper body mist. And their Cloud Musk is *such* a dupe for Glossier's You that I am stunned. Of course, it's not as long-lasting but, for the price, I'd rather keep re-applying Cloud Musk as often as needed. In my opinion, the perfume of Cloud Musk is better than the mist but I get a nicer boost from using both. I do the mist on my hair and clothes while I use the perfume on my skin."

423,Perfumes,"Help Identify this Scent, Please!","Hello! I'm kinda new to this sub but and figured that this was the best place to turn to.

A little context: Not sure if I'm allergic to it, but ever since I was little I noticed that there was this distinct smell that was only worn by women 50+ older (like fellow church-goers or relatives. Never got to ask-didn't think to at the time). Didn't effect me so much then, but now if I smell it on strangers I get throbbing headaches. I know y'all can't diagnose anything thru that, and I wouldn't ask you to, but I'm insanely curious as to what scent these women are wearing. At the very least, I'll have a better idea of what's going on/have a name for that darned smell. 

Last time I caught a whiff, it smelled like some herbs and spices, and maybe a hint of weed? It really just screamed ""incense"" to me, like some old-timey scent. If it's an actual perfume, it has to be something from the US or a cheap import that is from the 60s(70s?). Anything I researched myself didn't look to be it. Also, I bring up age because a relative once told me it could be a product you use at an elderly age to mask sweat or other? Sounds weird, I know, but if it rings a bell, then I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

If it's not, the best guess I have is some type of herbal oil or natural scent? When I tried to research on individual herbs/aromas for aromatherapy, and frankincense sounded like the closest to it by description. But, I'm a dumb-dumb when it comes to things like that, and don't have the means to test that theory. 

I hope this helps. I'll try to answer as best I can if y'all have anymore questions. And thank you so much in advance for taking the time to help/read!"

This is how Sephora describes Burberry Brit: Fragrance Family: Florals, Scent Type: Warm &amp; Sweet Gourmands, Key Notes: Icy Pear, Sugared Almond, Vanilla.

My favourite so far is the YSL Black Opium, but I don't LOVE it - maybe I'm too used to Burberry? I have also sampled YSL Libre Intense and Valentino Born in Roma and did not like them on me.  
Price range $100-150 CAD ideally, I'm 31 years old, she/her.

I like the notes in general but it does feel a little cheap (Please don't say Baccarat 540. It smells like grape to me). I like the warmth and creaminess. I think I like Cloud because it's sweet and a gourmand but it's not a vanilla or caramel which usually smells overly syrupy in my experience. 

I also like YSL La Nuit L'Homme 

I can't find a perfume I like and it's starting to feel annoying. Please help!

Notes I smell in cloud:

* Cream
* Musk? (It smells very warm and soft)
* Lavender/pear (It's very subtle. I usually don't like lavender because it smells like soap but it works here)
* Praline (very subtle. I think it would smell like grandma butterscotch candies if it were strong)

&amp;#x200B;

Similar perfumes I've looked into already and didn't like:

* Replica By the Fireplace (I actually do like this one but I get sick of it after smelling it over 1HR)
* YSL Black Opium (I hate coffee. This smells foul to me)
* Carolina Herrera Good Girl (Also smells foul. Like Hair salon with perm and hair dye and shampoo)
* Burberry Her (It's too floral. Smells like a church auntie)

465,Perfumes,Guanahani Ladies from the Perfume factory on Grand Bahama Island...,"Hey there! I used to live in Marathon, FL, in the middle Keys. As such, my backyard then was pretty much the Caribbean, and my front yard was basically the Bahamas. I wound up falling in love with a perfume called 'Guanahani' that I found in Freeport, GBI. 

Well, now being in Chicago I don't get to the Bahamas as often - the last time I did I bought several bottle sof Guanahani, but now I've run out - and they claim they're no longer able to ship to the US due to American Customs. This is their link (NOT Spam), in case you want to check it out: [https://www.perfumefactory.com/fragrance/guanahani-ladies/](https://www.perfumefactory.com/fragrance/guanahani-ladies/)

Their website describes Guanahani as: ""A sweet fresh floral ‚Äì jasmine, gardenia, tuberose, mandarin, ylang ylang, patchouli and nutmeg"". I have no idea if the way these ingredients are listed reflects the amount of each in the fragrance, or if it's just random. IMHO Guanahani is a very, very unique scent - I have not smelled anything else like it... And that's the problem.

I would love to have a dupe of it - something similar. Can you guys help me? Thanks in advance!"

I'm currently looking for a fun fragrance that I can use for work, preferably something that can last a while with decent projection. Since it's just for work, I'm fine with cheaper perfumes.

I've been looking through fragrances, and I've been wondering if some of the Britney ones might be right for me. In the past, I've worn perfumes that smell kind of like tropical fruits - Onika by Nicki Minaj, for example - as well as fragrances that have strong vanilla and chocolate smells. If I smell like cake or baking, then I'm happy lol.

I haven't smelled the Britney fragrances before, and I'm struggling to know the difference. I've read the different notes, but I'm struggling to gauge if any might be inappropriate for day to day wear.

The only other fragrance I've started looking into are the Ariana Grande ones. 

Can anyone make any recommendations please?

Thanks!"

563,Perfumes,quick review: Rag + Bone Oddity," I ordered a few masculine and unisex samples and fell in love with this scent! My usual perfume preference is hyper feminine gourmand or floral, but I was looking for a gift for the hubs. I picked out 'Encens"" by Rag + Bone because it was described as having a smoky incense-like profile, then I grabbed 'Oddity' on a whim as well. Encens is nice, but I think Oddity nails the incense vibe even better, and also reminds me of camping because of the woody notes. It is long lasting on the skin and I can't stop sniffing my wrist. It evokes a lot of warmth, spice, and smoke, and is very natural and down to earth. I think I will keep this one for me, heheh!"
564,Perfumes,Anyone do bottle mods for better display aesthetics?,"If the cap is plastic, then I remove it and display the bottle capless. If the bottle has a sticker label, then I remove it (Aramis 900).¬†

575,Perfumes,hi! can you recommend scents for me?,"sooo hi! i'm quite new to perfumes, and i don't quite know yet what i like exactly...   in case it's relevant, i'm a 19F genderfluid kid so i don't really mind whether it'll be feminine or masculine :)

in what i do know, i will definitely stray away from wild spicy and vanilla scents because it tends to make me nauseous...   i'm still quite young, so i don't want to go to sexy and mature scents yet. i know fruity scents are my safer scents, but i'd like to check for other scents that i might like better. 

so far in what i've seen, i think i'm interested in le labo santal 33 and chanel no.5 (50/50) because of their longevity and sillage. zara tobacco collection rich/warm/addictive, alkemia deus ex machina, and chris rusak after every ounce of joy has also caught my eye, mainly because of their tobacco and motor oil notes, though i haven't got a clue where or how i'll be able to get it + i'm still new and this might be quite a big jump for me.

any help is greatly appreciated. thank you in advance!"

It took me 4 hours to photography my entire collection. No accidental drops or broken glass, so I pat myself on the back for that.

I got my first perfume, Harajuku Lovers Music, when I turned 13 in 2009. My love for fragrances was born. I bought myself Black Star by Avril Lavigne for my school¬¥s 2009 Winter formal. CK One Summer 2012 was a gift for my 16th birthday. I started to really get into fragrances in 2017 with my first well paying job: I bought myself Olympea Intense and Black Opium Nuit Blanche.

I loved Glossier but only in the solid so I'm glad that it is back. I've tried Not A Perfume &amp; it was nice.

i remember the fragrance evoking such strong feelings of attraction and ravenous joy! [is that even a thing!?] it had this absolutely addicting magnetism that set off fireworks..!

at least, that's how i remember it. 

this was back in the mid-late 2000s and i imagine if i were to drop the $200something on an old bottle someone still has, the fragrance will likely be compromised. is there another that strikes similar to CK ONE ELECTRIC?"

676,Perfumes,Newbie here: Is Coco eau de parfum Chanel for winter or summer?,
677,Perfumes,Alternative to √î de Lanc√¥me?,"I love perfumes that mimic my favourite nature spots‚Ä¶woods, ocean, lemon. Fresh, approachable, down to earth.

678,Perfumes,Finding a Leather Lesbian Scent?,"Have been brainstorming what I want to smell like now that my last perfume bottle is out (Rentless from Lush, too sweet for me now but nonetheless sexy). I need help. I'm a mid 20s sapphic that wears a lot of leather and the classic black Levis/wifepleaser. I'm a bartender, Aquarius, drive a manual, preferred drink is a Negroni. I read a lot of nonfiction. Not as sensitive and tender as I would like to be. I'm a no touch top, dating history is all women with severe Catholic trauma (not on purpose) and if its not absolutely gritty sloppy terrifyingly decadent, I don't want it.

I want to smell like: your fingers after you've made ten Old Fashioneds in a row, repenting for a sin so delicious that it will never taste as good as the first time, 90s LA lesbian hookah lounge, the towel I use to wipe off my hands when I change my oil, End of Evangelion, candle that's burned slightly too long due to an engrossing first date, the last sliver of amber getting driven into the horizon at dusk, tasting sweat from a lover's neck, exhaust ballooning out of an 87' El Camino, walking into the New Mexico desert never to be seen again. 

Likes: leather, resin, woody scents, smelling like a church but in a sexy way

Dislikes: sweet cloying scents, large sillage, vanilla, hyper-masculine scents

My spending limit is $180 and I'm in the US."

But this fragrance is so weak on me and doesn‚Äôt last at all. There‚Äôs no way someone could smell this on me without literally putting their nose to my neck (trust me I asked). 

I want something with a little more pep, but still sensual in a similar way. Any recommendations? 

The freshness at the start makes me like this fragrance for the spring and summer. It doesn‚Äôt get too hot where I am and I‚Äôm mostly inside working anyway. Plus I love the sensuality of the fragrance. It‚Äôs sexy without trying too hard to be."

Obviusly i can still buy them from outside but maybe this is an alarm because my country is perifal and  obviusly if stocks are going down my country is going to be one of the first of losing their stock. 

Also maybe it's because there hasn't been any major shipment of them going in, or production by viktor&amp;Rolf is not very big because i have heard is sold out from other countries too. 

Or maybe it's the changes in the 49th IFRA amendment implemented in may 10. (The last IFRA change was in 2015 i think).

703,Perfumes,signature scents for an alt/metalhead aesthetic?,"hi! i actually don't have much experience with perfume, but i do like to smell good and i'd like to establish a signature scent that fits my aesthetic. 

like i said in the title, i prefer to dress in a generally alternative way. think lots of black, fishnets, metal band shirts, leather jackets, ripped clothing, big chunky black boots, flannels, etc.

i'd like more androgynous scents that aren't too sweet. i had Happy by Clinique for a while, and i liked the fresh, clean smell it had. but it was a completely random gift from my aunt, so i was looking to find something a little more me. maybe something sorta dark and mysterious, something that smells like the mountains or backstage at a rock concert. i'm totally down with niche, edgy, offbeat kind of scents. i'm young and don't have a lot of money, so i would prefer scents on the cheaper end of the spectrum.

thanks!"
704,Perfumes,Need more layering/blending ideas,"Okay, fragrance folks, I need some tips and suggestions. 

I have never had much success with layering/blending scents until now. I am 60 with drier (of course) skin and fragrances no longer smell as well or last as long for me - even oils. Now I have found this beautiful combo of Spears' Fantasy Intimate Edition and You from Glossier. 

When I first sampled Glossier's ""You"" (I think it was in a sub box), I fell IN LOVE &amp; had to have it. I got both the solid in a compact and a bottle of the perfume. I loved, loved, loved the solid but the bottled perfume was a huge waste of $60 &amp; I was ticked. I finished the compact (and thank goodness they have brought it back!) but the bottle has been sitting on my vanity. Every now and then I would use a spritz to see if aging made it better (it didn't).

The other day, I made a blind buy of Britney Spears' Fantasy Intimate Edition. Fragrantica's listing of the ""accords"" was everything I want in a fragrance - especially the first 4: vanilla, sweet, musky, powdery. 

I was really disappointed with the initial scent. Too child-like and sickly-floral on me. The dry-down was better but nothing like I expected. On a whim. I spritzed some You on top and... Good mercy! This is divine. The layering smells like the original sample (and solid) of You.

I need to try layering and blending fragrances more. This combo lasted for hours and hours - from 10-ish one morning until it muted down to a ""skin scent"" the next morning around 7 when I got up. 

I like those vanilla/caramel and powdery scents the most. Any suggestions are appreciated."
705,Perfumes,Looking for name of a perfume!,"Hey all! So I have been planning on buying this one perfume I have wanted for ages, but it was saved on my phone which was recently stolen and I can't remember what it was called! I searched everywhere for it but I can't find it so I was hoping someone here might be able to help &lt;3

So it's a perfume that is kind of woody and i think musky, and the bottle has tentacles on it. I don't know if this helps, but a few weeks ago I saw someone on tiktok mention it and they were saying it smells like pirate ships and the ocean. Also I don't think it was very expensive, maybe ranging from 50 Euro to 150 depending on volume.

Any help appreciated &lt;3"
706,Perfumes,What your thoughts of Viking by Creed??,"My father who is in his late 60s believes that it smells like the Original Paco Rabanne of his youth, of course he is fougere lover.. Viking does have that traditional aromatic fougere opening has that citrus, lavender &amp; lots of mint.

However, the dry down reminds me a lot of JPG Le Male, it feels premium and well blended, projecting and sillage is a beast, but Creed pricing $$$ I just cant digest paying premium for a 80s fougere.

I've been looking for a certain perfume for a while now and I can't find it again. Unfortunately I have barely any information to go on, this is all I've got. 

\- Bought it around 10 years ago in a Douglas store in Germany

\- Payed less than 100 ‚Ç¨ for it

\- The bottle is round from the front and from the sides the width is is about 1,5 - 2 cm (less then 0.787 inch)

\- It is transparent, clear glass but has dark blue or black stripes on the sides around the round front. 

\- I think it has the word ""rose"" or ""ros√©"" on it.

Unfortunately, I don't remember anything about the scent. I know this isn't much to go on and I hope my explanation was understandable. Does anyone have any idea what this could've been?"

I'm a perfumery student at ISIPCA in France and for my internship report I need to understand the perception people have of natural fragrances. 

To do so, I created a survey. The collected information will only be used for my report and won't be published anywhere. It takes maximum 5 min to answer and no specific knowledges are necessary. I just need a spontaneous and real opinion :).

I was lucky enough to visit the Aftelier before covid... It was so nice to get a google notification and learn more about her!!!

*Here's the start of the article:*

*A woman leaves a room, and her* *perfume* *lingers. She is gone, but something of her presence remains. The woman, perfumer* [*Mandy Aftel*](https://www.aftelier.com/)*, has slipped into another wing of her home in search of a relic.*¬†

*Scents are like souls, Marcel* *Proust* *wrote. They endure death and destruction, ""remembering, waiting, hoping...""*

*Fragrances are alive for Aftel, too. She calls them ""my friends,"" and once charmingly addressed a shelf of* *essential oils* *directly, asking, ""Is everybody here?""*

*Aftel is heir to a tradition that* *traces back* *six thousand years to* *Egypt**,  where incense was burned to purify sacred spaces. Later, in  Mesopotamia, the desire for more complex aromatics inspired some of  humanity's earliest chemistry experiments. One* *cuneiform tablet*  *dating to 1200 BC names the world's first-recorded chemist, a female  perfumer named Tapputi. From that era onward, precious fragrances  proliferated via the Silk Road, reached mass adoption in the ""Perfumed  Court"" of King Louis XV, and currently comprise a* *30 billion dollar* *global industry that includes Aftel's cozy atelier here in Berkeley, California.*¬†¬†¬†

*The seventy-four-year-old returned clutching a notebook. ""This is  it,"" she announced. The pages document seasons of struggle as the artist  attempted to recreate the precise natural scent of someone she had  loved and lost ‚Äì a perfume she would eventually name* [*Memento Mori*](https://www.aftelier.com/Memento-Mori-Eau-de-Parfum-Spray-p/liq-edp-mementomori.htm)*. ""The process mirrored the relationship itself,"" she confessed. ""Torturous.""*

*It had been a solitary period, reminiscent of the perfumer's  childhood in 1950s Detroit. Growing up in a synthetic miasma of  ""asphalt, detergent, and chlorinated swimming pools,"" the scents of her  youth were unfriendly ones.*"

I am very new to perfumes and do not have a good sense of what something might smell like by just reading the notes. I'm looking for something warm and preferably woodsy as well, but I also like warm florals. I know this probably isn't the typical scent profile to go with for a wedding but I can't stand very floral perfumes like flowerbomb and gucci bloom. 

For reference, I really enjoy YSL black opium and libre, as well as jo malone wood sage and sea salt. I just wanted a special perfume that I only wear on my wedding day and anniversaries.

Looking for recommendations on a good berry/pomegranate/fruity perfume.

im not rly knowledgeable in the way of perfumery, but i'm trying to find a perfume to stick to / signature scent. problem is, idk what i like or don't like (general trends). my favorite perfumes (that i've tried so far, age 21) are guerlain's shalimar, tom ford's black orchid and the newest fave addition is narciso rodriguez's pure musc (which is quite different to the 2 previous ones, isn't it? i feel like it's more of a light summer scent). recently i looooved dsquared2's original (i don't care if it's„Äämale„Äãor„Ääfemale„Äãperfume btw). d&amp;g's l'imperatrice was alright too but too... sweet? mild? soft?? for me. i didn't like any of the bvlgari omnias i've tried &amp; i didn't like guerlain's insolence (too flowery).

 what would you say is my tendential preference, what perfumes/scents should i look for? any specific recommendations?"

885,Perfumes,Signature scent help,"hey, guys so im a teen girl. I need a signature scent. my goal is to have people remember me by it and a routine I can stay consistent with. In terms of the scent I want to smell good, a mix of sweet and floral and just fresh/clean. Basically, something I can wear at school, at parties, fancy events, basically a signature to me so it has to be appropriate for all types of events.  I already have a lot of perfumes just have trouble choosing. 

Some of my favourites are: 

\- tease by victories secret (this is my favourite but I don't know what to layer it with and it barely lasts but the scent is my personal favourite. I am trying to pair it with the Brazillian bum bum lotion from sole de Janeiro and it smells good just really expensive.)

\- bombshell by victories secret (smells good but its a little fancier for school and that in my opinion let me know if you think differently)

\- heavenly by victorias secret (this is a super clean, non-offensive scent and I like it but I want a young sweetish floral hint to it too which it doesn't give me) 

\- I also have a lot of bath and body works my favs are a thousand wishes and champagne toast but I want something more unique for me so I'm not sure this is the best as it's very basic and not very long-lasting. 

Please let me know your thoughts as well as any cheap signature scent recommendations you have for me to wear everywhere. If anyone has any nice layering products with any of the perfumes I mentioned, Pls let me know!!"

990,Perfumes,From one extreme to another‚Ä¶ need reccomendations,"So ‚Ä¶ my taste in fragrances is super diverse but also hyper specific.
I will literaly spend an hour at a shop trying 30 different things just to like maybe one or two but then not getting anything because im not 100% convinced.

I tend to either go for verry easy going lighter floral and/or fruity scents ( think chanel chance eau tendre or DKNY be delicious) or throw all that away and select heavier, intense ( i often describe it as arrogant too) stuff like montale caffee intense.

For financial reasons i always limited myself to just owning 3 bottles. Only looking for a new one whenever i compeletly used up one. 

At the moment i own Montale Caffee intense, Carolina Herrera very good girl and Mugler angel eau crossiere 2020‚Ä¶. love the first two, wouldnt go for the mugler again.
its a tad too sweet for my liking but i pretty much finished it up now.

Basicaly what im looking for is another light, fresh spring/summer scent that still has abit on an ‚Äöedge‚Äò to it OR ( and this is what i would love to find the most) finaly find my perfect inbetween. Something unique and abit heavier but still palatable for everyday use.

I know this discription might be all over the place so i would just be thankfull for a few reccomendations to have a list of  what to try out the next time i enter a store."

there was this one scent that anthony was raving about so much and it sounded so interesting- this is what anthony said about it: 

- had a wood scent to it

- didnt smell so special on the wrist or what ever but smelled really special in the air around you..so it would not seem that great when you were smelling it or what ever but in the actual atmosphere around you it would be incredible for some reason

- he said something about how theres a fancy hotel in dubai or some thing where they pump this fragrance through the vents 24-7..not sure if he meant that every guest at the hotel is always wearing this scent or if he said that the hotel literally pumps it through the vents lol..

- cant remember if it was womens only or unisex..pretty sure it wasnt mens only

anyway i wonder if any fans of that youtube channel (curly scents) knows what im talking about it bc i thought it was so interesting how he described it and i really want to find this fragrance"

1071,Perfumes,":) Recommendations for clean, fresh scents!","Hello! I‚Äôm hoping someone reads this and would like to give me (F20) a recommendation on a fragrance to buy! It would be awesome. I‚Äôm looking for a fresh scent, that is feminine yet not too flowery/sweet/fruity or musky/gourmand/oriental, also not too chemical, that you could wear to any occasion all year round. All price ranges. The ‚Äúclean smell‚Äù is so lovely, especially if it has a signature to it, like fresh sheets but more fragrance-like. My only concerns with this type of smell are that one would end up smelling like a 2$ soap if you know what I mean, I hope to avoid that, or simply smelling boring. Another smell I like is the woody, cedar type of smell which I guess contradicts what I previously said, but maybe there's a combination out there somewhere. The only fragrance I‚Äôve smelled for longer periods is Good Girl - Carolina Herrera, it was too musky/oriental/vanilla/chocolate for me and I didn‚Äôt really like it. I do have two smells I liked and became obsessed with, a pair of fragrance sticks, the scents are explained like this:

‚ÄúAntique Green‚Äù: A fresh herbal scent with notes of melon, peach, lily of the valley and cedarwood.

‚ÄúWhite Satin‚Äù: A clean scent with notes of orchid, jasmine, lily of the valley and cedarwood.

I know little about perfume so I hope I could explain the scent I‚Äôm looking for a little at least, hopefully someone reads and has a recommendation! Have a good day :)"

I have been searching for a very special fragrance for years, but because I can only describe it from memory, it has been a little difficult. When I was 9, in 2005 or 2006, my aunt gave me a sample spray of a lemony, rich, sweet, delicious perfume. I DOUSED myself in it because I was so proud to have a bottle of perfume, and because I was so proud that my aunt chose to give it to me. I recall it smelled like Italian lemon, maybe even a little like lemon cake, though I recall its tartness. I remember it being in a rectangular bottle, and perhaps this is a figment of my imagination, but I vaguely recall a lemon being on the bottle. This may or may not be true. All I know for certain is it was lemon HEAVY. Does anyone recall a fragrance from the 2000s that sounds like this? I would love to reexperience it."

1118,Perfumes,"Looking for a certain ""Christmas cookie"" type scent","About ten years ago around Christmas time, I was working distribution in a post office. As I was sorting packages I came across a scent that has haunted me ever since. The smell was coming from one of the packages, I think, but we were so busy and I never got to figure out which package it was before I sorted them all out to the carriers for the day...

It smelled like freshly baked sugar cookies combined with a kind of pine tree scent. And maybe a snowy smell-or what you'd think snow smelled like - But the prevailing smell was that of freshly baked cookies with sugared crystals on top. But also with like a pine tree snow smell. It's frustrating because I can't really explain it accurately. But I would know it if I smelled it again which sadly has not happened yet. I have tried all kinds of ""holiday"" themed scents from different places and nothing has come close. 

I am beginning to think that my memory has distorted how brilliant the smell was and perhaps it wasn't as magical as I remembered.  Does anyone have any suggestions? 

*it's possible that the smell was actually baked cookies being sent in the mail which is what everyone at work told me. But I really think it could've been coming from a bundle of magazines that had perfume samples in it (?) I mean that's a possibility as well. I swear it had like a perfumed quality to it that made me think that it wasn't actual cookies"

Oh my god. I hate to say that I love this so so much because it's so painfully expensive, even on discount sites and eBay shipping where I am is always really pricey.

Perfumes I've loved: 

Clean Reserve - Solar Bloom

Armani - Acqua di Gioia

Nest - Sunkissed Hibiscus (most worn currently but feels a bit too floral at times. I love the warmth.)

Elizabeth and James - Nirvana White and Nirvana Black (two of my favorites but now discontinued ): )

Perfumes I don't like: 

Le Labo - Santal 33 (too woody)

MFK - Baccarat Rouge 540 (based on descriptions I thought I would love this. It's too musky / heavy on me)

Burberry - Her London Dream (too sweet)

If I‚Äôm correct they redid the formula in like 2002 and made it more fruity scented. That‚Äôs not the one I had or am remembering. It was my first ‚Äúadult‚Äù perfume and I liked it a lot, but they discontinued it. While I did like the perfume I feel like there is something better out there that I will love. 

What I really liked about MK perfume was the primarily sweet floral scent. I want to literally smell like I bathed in flower nectar, honey, and sunlight. I think it also had a slight almost powdery undertone if I remember right. It was very feminine. My favorite perfume right now is Roses de Chloe which to me has a light sweet floral scent but is not too sweet. It‚Äôs absolutely wonderful, but it‚Äôs not quite perfect. Sometimes I mix it with a tiny tiny bit of vanilla scented perfume that almost exactly hits home for what I‚Äôm looking for. I think it adds a cozy warmth to it that gives it a little something something. 

I‚Äôm not super knowledgeable about perfumes so I‚Äôm sorry if my explanation isn‚Äôt very good. I spent two hours at Sephora with an employee who was determined to find the right perfume for me. That‚Äôs how I found the roses de Chloe. Apparently I have a very specific idea of what I want and it‚Äôs hard to find haha. If you can recommend something I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I would prefer to physically go somewhere and smell a sample before I buy it. Money is tight but this is something I‚Äôve been searching for, for a long time.

I was totally transported to my happiest place. I live in Stockholm and everyone here is obsessed with Byredo, everyone smells good but also the same, the range is very narrow.

1236,Perfumes,Discovered a new fragrance!!!,"A few days ago, I went to a perfume shop and Cicuta by V Canto caught my eye because the bottle is beautiful, so I sprayed the tester on myself and continued my day to check its performance. I‚Äôm embarrassed to tell you how many compliments I got during the day and at work.

I was surprised to realize that its silage is enormous, and its longevity was long-lasting to such an extent that even today, after a few days, I can still smell the beautiful, sweet smell with a slight of citrusy scent on my scarf.

Cicuta opens with clementine, orange, and bergamot. The heart notes are rose, Bulgarian rose and coriander whereas the base notes are vanilla, vanilla flower, birch, musk, borage and amber. The only thing I‚Äôve got to say about this one, is that it‚Äôs blended in a perfect way and the strong scent of vanilla that is blended with the Bulgarian rose just makes it magical.

Let‚Äôs not forget the fact that the citrusy notes in this fragrance balance the sweetness of the rose and makes it smell like HEAVEN! This perfume is definitely a MUST for rose lovers as it smells like a bouquet of red roses and will get you so many compliments because the smell stays in the air even if you leave the room.

D&amp;G light blue which while i love how refreshing the scent is, I don‚Äôt find it very versatile/ i feel kinda constrained to a certain weather or vibe to wear it

I really like the praline and raspberry in it. 

I'm looking for something similar to it. Not necessarily similar notes (although that would be preferable since it's discontinued and very hard to find nowadays), but just a similar vibe, if that makes sense - dark and sweet but sophisticated and not headache inducing.

I tried Black Opium EDP and Hypnotic Poison EDP and did not like either. Good Girl EDP by Carolina Herrera was just okay to me. I really liked Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme.

He wasn't able to give me enough info on what he wanted, only that he didnt want anything too sweet, probably more inclined towards a leather, woody or smoked vibe, but gave me a visual representation. ""Imagine a man, drinking whiskey, in a crimsom lighted room, sitting next to a fireplace"". So basically he wants to look like Thomas Shelby...

The fragrances is inspired by the power and calmness of nature and It's a fragrance that is not in a liquid state, but in a natural solid state. Perhaps that's part of its appeal.

 While being solid, its design includes a capsuled shell made from an Zamak alloy that can handle the wear and tear of daily use all while being extremely portable - you can take it anywhere with you! 

 It‚Äôs called Aroma | 59 and it‚Äôs made with alcohol-free, natural anhydrous wax base that they say melts onto your skin with the warmth of your body.  

The really cool thing is that it was launched on Kickstarter and in just 13 mins of going live - the project was fully funded.

1366,Perfumes,I'm overwhelmed by what clones I should be focusing on making...so help me out: Which clone should I make next? And also what do you guys think of cloning high-end fragrances ? :),"Hey guys! I'm Nawar and I'm a huge scent enthusiast. You could say it's kind of my life's passion.

But you know what? The whole world of high-end fragrances has always felt a little too exclusive to me, and too expensive. Like, why should only the richest 1% be able to enjoy the smells that they want to wear?

So I did what any smart internet entrepreneur would do: I started cloning them.

Now look, I know some of you are thinking: ""That's not cool, man!"" But it totally is. And yeah some of ya'll be thinking ""This guy's a copycat!"" But let me ask you this: do you think Gucci copied Ralph Lauren when they came out with their signature polo shirt? No! They just saw something cool and wanted to make their own version of it. Some of these companies charge $400+ for a bottle of perfume that costs them $20-50 to make. And they'll tell you it's because they're using rare ingredients cultivated from the tears of unicorns or something, but please. It's all just marketing BS.

So yeah, my clones probably aren't going to smell exactly like the real thing, and yeah some do smell better than originals (at least that's what my customers tell me which is hilarious because it should be impossible haha), but if you want to try out some new scents without breaking the bank‚Äîor if you just think these luxury brands are charging way too much for their products‚ÄîI'm your guy.

I'm now overwhelmed with what to clone next, so I'm taking suggestions from you all and will choose my next project based on which fragrance gets the most upvotes in this thread. Don't be shy‚Äîplease suggest away!"

I smelled the extreme version in store an accidentally bought the regular (so maybe I want extreme instead but idk I didn‚Äôt smell many) and 2. It‚Äôs just a little overbearing.

1423,Perfumes,New release by V Canto,"This new perfume - Misiarte by V Canto is such a special one with amazing note you've never thought would work together. 

It opens up with sweet citrusy notes - Calabrian bergamot, Brazilian orange, grapefruit and pineapple. Then, the heart notes are coconut, damask plum, lily-of-the-valley, jasmine sambac, leather and RASPBERRY which give a tropical, floral and fruity scent (WOW, who thought raspberries can give such a special scent??) and this leads to an amazinggg dry down of a soft, almond-like vanilla caramel note.

Oh, this is a wonderful fragrance. I am so glad I got to smell this masterpiece.

1431,Perfumes,Exposed to a new beautiful fragrance :),"Ok so while my Euro trip I got exposed to this new perfume F.da Montefeltro by V Canto. 

It has a great opening of fresh, clean and citrusy fragrance with lovely floral, sweet, cozy and woody middle notes thanks to the ylang-ylang, flowers, amber and gurjan balsam. When I first sprayed it on myself, the first thing that I smelled were the flowers. Oh, that opening is so beautiful, freshy and obsessing. 

Then this beautiful fragrance dries down to a dark, soft, woody scent with a slightly pinch of vanilla which makes it warmer and cozier and feel like running in the forest while warm wind is coming towards us. In my opinion, the fact that it has vanilla in the dry down, yes even that pinch of vanilla, makes me fall for it not only because I love the smell of vanilla but also the warmth it gives and how cozy it makes the fragrance feel on my skin. 

LOVELY!

I am someone who usually doesn't spray a lot. I like my scents close to my skin, and don't really care about sillage. I do however care about lasting power. How do both versions compare in regards to it?

The cute and easily transportable packaging of the solid version is definitely a bonus for lasting power and touch ups too since i see myself using it as a subtle everyday fragrance.

I guess what i'm really asking is would the additional 30 bucks be justified to spend in the spray bottle version ?"

Anyway, of course I‚Äôd smelled it before growing up, my mom had a bottle. But this morning I found myself compulsively over-spraying in the throes of delight (I‚Äôm sure there are fragheads who can relate to doing this at times). Then it hit me‚Äîmy goodness, the relationship between Chanel No. 5 and Guerlain‚Äôs Samsara is remarkable. When I looked up the notes of both, I wasn‚Äôt wrong, they share so, so many notes and structure. And both are so well blended and balances, as most icons/masterpieces are.

I‚Äôm not going to pick favorites, but I think Chanel No. 5 is the more ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù fragrance. However I do appreciate the drama of Samsara and it‚Äôs in my rotation. My point is‚Ä¶if you are die-hard for one of these, check the other if you haven‚Äôt already.

1510,Perfumes,Customer Perfume- Need Help Picking Notes,"Hey all. Need help picking out notes for custom perfumes I'm planning to order. I'm pretty young, so most of my perfume experience has come from whatever's popular at the time. I'm looking to get 2 perfumes done and have been doing my best to identify which notes I like and which I don't. Suggestions of perfumes that contain notes I'm working with or fit the vibe would help as well! 

The first perfume: Lynx

Looking for a vibe similar to Born in Roma and Black Opium. Neither is bad, but I'd really like to switch things up and have a perfume that takes on a similar role (dark, gourmand, light floral note) My fear is making something either powdery or too sweet.  I would argue Born in Roma is almost too powdery (I think it's the jasmine.) 

I'm currently thinking: Vanilla, Bourbon, Cashmere, Almond, Something lightly fruity/floral to balance out, Something to ground the sweets. I'm unsure what to use for those two.

The second perfume: Leaves

Looking for a watery/clean scent with very light florals. Trying to avoid fruits- though pomegranate seems to be alright. I associate it with the sharp notes in Calvin Klein's Euphoria. Have not yet picked notes out that would fill this.

I do own Versace's Yellow Diamond, and feel that it's a solid enough white floral scent. I mainly use it for work related events. Lynx would aim to fill the hole left by Black Opium. Leaves would be something fairly new that I've yet to find a good perfume for. Sort of a spring-like smell. I didn't mind Armani's Aqua di Gio for Men- but was looking for something just slightly more feminine. 

Feel free to throw your input my way on any of this! I'm hopeful that y'all's noses will be a bit more attuned to these notes and know which ones play best with them. I'm hoping the custom perfumes will turn out well. I'm unsure what carrier oil to request, though am leaning towards Sweet Almond.

Thank you!"

1514,Perfumes,Only one perfume works on me?,Is something wrong with my nose? I have tried spraying many different perfumes on myself and they smell great for like 2 minutes. After that I can literally smell nothing again and can never smell perfume on anyone else.  I have only discovered one perfume that I can still smell on my skin when I go to bed after I sprayed it on several hours prior. Why is only one perfume lasting on me?

I just bought the Versace Pour Homme EDT from a pretty big online retailer here in Belgium (bol.com), and I'm kind of suspicious of the packaging. I paid ‚Ç¨57,95 for 100ml (3.4 US fl.oz.). The plastic wrapping looks really amateuristic compared to other perfume brands I bought, and in the ingredient list every first letter of every word is capitalized (which looks weird to me). These two things made me very suspicious initially, but perhaps someone here can shed some light on my situation :)

1576,Perfumes,Black XS for her EDT vs EDP,"Hi there!

So, in the past I used to be obsessed with Black XS for her, and had the EDT and Black XS L‚Äôexces. They have been discontinued as you all probably know, but I may have managed to find a new bottle of the Black XS EDT (looks the same as it used to). 


However, I remembered that there is a new one, and it‚Äôs an EDP, so I am debating if I should just get that one. 

I have smelled both, and even though there is a slight difference, I would be happy with either of them, scent-wise. One of my most important criteria for perfumes is longevity, which is why I‚Äôm considering the EDP, but I do know that of course, it‚Äôs not always the case that EDPs are more long lasting than EDT. The old EDT used to be a beast in longevity. 


So, if anyone has had both of these or has some thoughts or recommendations, I would be happy to hear them! 

Thanks!"

Another perfume sketch from The Portraits series is dedicated to the romantic and at the same time determined Helen. Therefore, the fragrance is built on the contrast of bright tangerine notes that set off the floral heart, in which tuberose reigns with its sweet-creamy sound.

1709,Perfumes,How to a choose signature perfume in just 4 steps |,"
Now that we've understood in previous blogs already that fragrances fall into different price ranges and they can be either most expensive or just in the budget that's totally up to us because we decide the range beforehand. Now let's discuss how we can go and pick the perfect fragrance for ourselves or our loved ones. We know¬†""the types of signature scents¬†And¬† 

How to choose a perfume according to your age and liking.


Now it's time to go and shop for that happy fragrance.



Pick up a good store¬†:


Always pick a store where the staff knows what they're dealing with and how they can provide the best to their customers. Because some stores do not have a staff which is familiar with fragrances so avoid going to those stores. Whereas picking up a store which has eligible staff that can assist you properly. Tell them your preferences and budget and they'll help you get the exact fragrance that you want. Some recommended fragrances are¬†bath and body works, titan, marks, and spencers. These are the brands that can be trusted without having tried.

How to try perfumes:

Do not sniff so many perfumes at once because this can confuse the decision by many folds. Firstly to get the idea of the perfume sniff from the cap only because this will give the idea that you will like that fragrance or not.


Note that the fragrance which is making you feel like you would want to and give you happiness and confidence is the perfect fragrance for you.


If you want to try many fragrances avoid putting them on yourself ask for the blotter sheets and sprit the fragrance on it leave it to set for 10-20 seconds and then sniff from a distance this will help the top note to set and the fragrance will be more clear.¬†



Things to keep in mind while shopping for perfume/EDP:


* Don't just go and pick the fragrance in one go just because you like the top note of it perfumes have a good amount of alcohol in them and after some time it evaporates and you might dislike the fragrance of it later.¬†


* Do not wear any kind of fragrance before going to buy one.


* While switching one fragrance to another fragrance just give your nose a natural scent on either of your shirts, your skin, or go outside to get the smell of nature so that you don't feel overwhelmed by the fragrances.¬†


Pick the one perfect perfume:


When you have decided on a perfume ""wear it"". Wear the fragrance that you feel most attracted to. Do not spritz it on your clothes directly as it contains alcohol that can stain the cloth. Also, you can keep blotter sheets with yourself or just ask for a sample of that particular perfume to try before you buy. As perfumes are expensive and people don't buy them just because they find the bottle attractive. These stores always keep samples with them. So just go ahead and ask for one, tell them you are thinking of buying this perfume but you need to be sure before you buy it and they'll be happy to give you a sample of it which you can use just to be sure.



Wait for a day - Wearing a fragrance doesn't make any sense if at the end of the day you can't even smell it. Just wait for a whole day and see how it works ""if it lasts longer on you or not"", ""if the people you are surrounded by like it or they find it irritable"" you'll know whether it works for you or against you!


Observe everything related to your perfume :

Observe - All the notes carefully they must be liked by you because some perfumes have the best top notes but they get mixed up with the body odor and make it worse by the end of the day it can smell pathetic so pay attention, it's important to observe how it works on your skin type.


When you've observed the notes of the perfume and know if you like it or not just decide and get that large bottle for yourself to spread the charm of your personality. You'll see a good fragrance can make a lot of changes to your personality and when you decide to change your fragrance go ahead and find a new one.


If you still don't reach your fragrance:


If you've tried all the steps and still think that you like more than one fragrance then also you have a lot of choices you should go ahead and buy the¬†combo packs¬†of smaller bottles or the¬†tester packs.¬† 

Now that you have decent knowledge about how to buy the perfect fragrance you can go ahead and get one for yourself confidently. These points will help you select the right one so get yourself the best fragrance that suits you and your personality like magic."
1710,Perfumes,'Stronger With You Intensely' or 'By The Fireplace',"I'm deciding between these two fragrances but do not know what to get. Both of them smell similar with that chestnut and vanilla, but I do really like that burnt wood opening from 'by the Fireplace'. I'm in my early twenties and looking for something to wear going out at night in the winter months."
1711,Perfumes,Recommendations please!!,"Im looking for something I would describe as ‚Äúfresh but warm/sensual‚Äù 

I dont care for vanilla as a main scent, I think its a bit overused and would like to stay away from it. 

A fresh perfume I like is Light Blue by Dolce 

And a warm perfume I like is Good Girl by Carolina Herrera. 

Id like something that combines both of these fragrances though. 

Maybe something like ‚Äúspiced *insert fruit here*‚Äù."

1763,Perfumes,Signature scent for my aesthetic,"I have been using Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gioia for a long time now but would like to try something new.

The Aesthetic I'm Looking For: Evoking an imagery of striking gorgeousness in a dreamy/ethereal way. Delicate yet commanding personality. Femme fatale but in a little sundress. Something that may also evoke nostalgia of a time gone by (like shalimar but not that strong). Of a time past that you long for but it will never happen again (say something classic or medieval or vintage). Something timeless.

I havent found any characters to explain what i am looking for but the basic idea i can give from historical novels is this lady who is very well trained with swords/martial arts but is also very gorgeous in a petite feminine way - strikingly gorgeous in an ethereal goddess way. I would like something that embodies commanding and imposing personality but a delicate feminine way of dress. Something that evokes a dark and cool nostalgia (in a dark academia way) but is also fresh (think grass, lime, mist, waterfalls).

A chilly, mystical and ethereal scent befitting the queen of the elves.

Notes I Like: Citrus, Aqua/ Water, Grass, waterfalls/mist, sandalwood, rosewater (so not as concentrated as rose), vanilla (not too strong but rather the lighter vanilla), snow, ice.  
I tend to get headaches from very strong or floral scents. I especially like those scents which feels chilly, fresh, delicate but still blatantly sexy/seductive.

I have been trying to find something like this for a long time but no success yet."

I dabble in perfume making as a hobby, I used to put 30% essential oils and top it up with an odorless oil (like jojoba oil). I was quite happy with the results. 

This time I tried to experiment with using ethanol. 
I put 30% essential oils, 40% jojoba oil as carrier, and 30% ethanol (perfumer's alcohol). I thought adding alcohol would help get better sillage and preserve the perfume longer.

I made the perfume but I'm not that impressed and I think the oils didn't mix well. Should I wait a couple of hours for the ethanol to do its magic and dissolve the essential oils? Should I have used alcohol and water instead of using a carrier oil?"

A few years ago I bought Madonna‚Äôs Truth or Dare for my mum. It was a blind buy, and I only picked it because my mum idolises Madonna- I lucked out, it actually smelled really good.

I tried to get her it again when she ran out, and by this point the prices were a lot higher and I was confused, did some digging and found it was discontinued. I managed to get her a smaller bottle for about as much as I paid last time.

Fast forward to now, my sister asked for it too. The price point it way too much for me now, even for the smallest bottle.

I googled around to find similar smelling perfumes but the ones recommended were even MORE expensive than what Truth or Dare is going for these days!

So I need your expert noses to help me find a perfume that is as close to Truth or Dare as possible while remaining in a less than ¬£30 price range. I‚Äôm not expecting miracles, I know at such a low cost, it‚Äôs not going to be exact, but we can try!

My limited knowledge of perfume has me understanding that there are different levels of scent, and I remember my sister describing it as flowery, so perfumes that are most similar in this aspect will beat out perfumes that maybe match other scents.

Thank you so much for your help!"

\- Winter fragrance  
\- Summer fragrance  
\- ""Date night"" or ""I'm going away for the weekend"" fragrance  
\- Office fragrance  
\- Causal fragrance

3. Allure Homme - EDT  
4. Allure Homme Sport Eau Extr√©me - EDP

1828,Perfumes,"And Ode to J‚Äôadore by Dior, an old timeless classic IMO","I‚Äôve been meaning to write this for some time since I purchased my first ever bottle of this perfume a few months ago. However this perfume has been known to me for awhile. 

I distinctly remember seeing magazine ads (with the little smelling sample) for this perfume when I was in middle school like mid 2000s. I thought it smelled amazing. I desperately wanted it. I think I asked for it for my birthday not knowing the price but it was absolutely out of the price range for my low middle class family and again I was like 13 years old so totally appropriate for my hardworking parents to NOT buy me a $100+ bottle of perfume. 

I would seek out similar scents sort of subconsciously over the next few years. Magnolia and jasmine stand out the most to me. I bought a magnolia body spray from bath and body works and used that forever into my college years, it‚Äôs since discontinued unfortunately. I‚Äôve had other jasmine perfumes.

Fast forward many years I‚Äôm now 30 and making a solid income, honestly I‚Äôm in a financial position beyond my wildest thoughts as a 13 year old. I finally decide to achieve this small at the time unattainable dream and buy this perfume Ive wanted forever. Such a satisfying feeling. It‚Äôs better than I remember. Hothouse floral aromas. Great lasting power. And I‚Äôm a fan of Charlize Theron who I remember from the old ads but had no idea who she was at the time. 

It‚Äôs a pretty mature scent but at the same time brings me back to my teenage hopes and aspirations.

I know it‚Äôs been a classic for a long time but maybe it‚Äôs not as trendy anymore since I don‚Äôt see it mentioned much here and it never seems front and center in big fancy department stores. Miss Dior seems to be a more front facing line for them now."

I just bought a dior homme intense perfume for about 130‚Ç¨ from a very  renowned perfume shop here in Albania, I don't have any doubt about the perfumes authenticity but there was some discrepancy.
Under the box  it was written EDP as is should be, because homme intense comes only as EDP.
Meanwhile the bottle was as it should be and the cap aswell Homme intense., but under the bottle it was written EDT.
Te batch numbers correspondent as well.
The perfumes are quite similar so I couldn't tell which one is it. 
The box was sealed when I bought it 
I am asking could the batch numbers be the same from two different fragrances?
Could it be that it is an Homme EDP and only the Cap is homme intense.

1851,Perfumes,getting addicted to buying perfumes,"last year, i started buying perfumes and gosh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so addicting. i feel like many fragrances i smell are so nice in their own way i just have to buy them. 
it doesn‚Äôt help that i‚Äôm a broke college student and perfumes are expensive! 

i‚Äôm trying to stop buying full bottles and just get travel sizes, especially if i‚Äôm not sure i love them. but some of the full size bottles are just too cute üò≠ 

i‚Äôm definitely not into niche perfumes and don‚Äôt have a favorite type yet. still exploring and figuring out what i like. my first perfume was gifted to me by my sister. it‚Äôs Chanel Coco Mademoiselle. Although this perfume smells nice, it gave me a headache and just wasn‚Äôt right for me. I was also gifted Ralph Lauren Romance and Cartier le Baiser du Dragon. Again nice perfumes but not me. 

I went ahead and purchased Glossier You as an everyday perfume, Lanc√¥me Idole for something fancier. I love the dry down but dislike the citrus smell in the beginning. This is beginning to be more of my every day perfume now. I got Marc Jacobs Daisy because the bottle is so cute. Just purchased La Vie Est belle as well as a travel size of Olympea and Black Opium. Black opium smells so amazing!

1869,Perfumes,Searching for this smell for 19 years,"TLDR: Searching for a sandalwood/jasmine soft scent from my childhood for almost 20 years
-
My godmother gave me scented a√ßa√≠ beads when I was a child (at least 19 years ago) and they smelled absolutely magical and unlike anything I ever smelled.

As an adult, I realize the notes that get closest to it are sandalwood and jasmine. It wasn't a very sweet smell at all and it had no citrus or any other ""sharp"" notes. It was the type of smell you could just breath in. It didn't make your nose 'shut down' from the punchiness because it was very soft. 

I recently smelled [Fleur D'Oranger 27](https://www.lelabofragrances.com/fleur-doranger-27-134.html) by Le Labo and that gets close-ish but it has more citrus than the scent I've been searching for. 

Anyone has any thoughts on scents that could get me closer to it?"

I usually wear a fruity smelling deodorant, right now it's the Secret nectarine solid one, and I use B&amp;BW Magic in the Air body wash (it says it's almond flower, white iris, and whipped vanilla scented), cocoa butter body oil, and cocoa and shea butter lotion. I also use Maui Moisture shea butter shampoo and coconut oil conditioner, as well as the Not Your Mother's Curl Talk foam and cream (plus the deep conditioner when I need it, they smell kinda fruity and floral, idk what I think they smell like but when I Googled it trying to find the notes people have said raspberry, grape candy, berry-ish, and ""like a drink with an umbrella in it"". The ingredients say it has shea butter and rice curl complex in it, but it also says it has parfum in it so idk what the notes of the fragrance they put in it are to give you a better idea of what it smells like. But the scent isn't super strong after my hair dries) and argan oil gel and hair oils. 

I've been eyeing the Kayali Juicy Apple perfume but I think it's sold out right now and idk if it's coming back, I think I would like it but I've never smelled it before.

1912,Perfumes,"Looking for a perfume that smells like wildflowers, herbs and conifers","Hi, I've never been into commercial perfumes because I've never found a scent I liked. I tend to get really overwhelmed by scent when trying to choose a perfume so I gave up.

I have a favorite essence oil scent for making various home-made stuff (candles, flax hair gel etc). I'm using wild thyme, pine and a tiny bit of lavender (2-2-1 or 3-3-1)  I've tried making it into a homemade perfume, but it barely lasts any time at all, plus it's a very simple ""composition"". I'd basically like to find an advanced take on that or a similar theme in a professional perfume. Anyone does something like that?"

1932,Perfumes,I want to smell like semen &amp; sex - Any suggestions?,"So after having done some research, it doesn't seem like there is any perfume out there that aims to smell like sex, semen and female bodily fluids (correct me if I'm wrong though).

So lets say I tried creating a formula like this myself using absolute and essential oils, would it be possible? And what chemicals or natural oils would be similar to the smell of semen?

I think I'd also throw in a bit of red wine, tobacco, chocolate and authentic deer musk to spice things up further.

I think the first ingredient would have to be salt. Because semen is quite salty. But there obviously needs to be something more. Chlorine perhaps? How would you go about finding the ingredients? And how would you formulate this ""sexiness in a bottle""?"
1933,Perfumes,"The facts of smells, the strange, and the wonderful.","We can be addicted to a Luxury scent or loath it to the point where if we were to get a whiff of it we feel nauseous and sometimes even sick, but why is that? Study shows the way we perceive certain scents is heavily dependent on our emotions, for example, if you smelt a [Luxury](http://www.ramasat.com/en) Dubai Perfume on a day where you are very excited and overall happy you would most likely find yourself feeling excited and happy the next time that same scent were to enter your nostrils, however, if you had the first encounter with that same perfume on a day where you‚Äôve gotten fired from your job you might not be so eager to smell that Luxury perfume again this is because our sense of smell is very much connected to our memory and emotions. Put it this way if you love how something smells, you also love how it makes you feel.

What‚Äôs interesting about smells is not only can they make you feel something when you wear them but everyone around you as well gets a sense of the impression you are trying to give off, euphoric scents are everything when you are trying to court attention, Ramasat a luxurious Dubai perfume company offers some of the most intoxicating and interesting fragrances known to be a definite head-turner. Quick Luxury perfume fact: your perfume speaks for you in volumes.

Dubai millennium a notorious [Dubai Perfume](https://ramasat.com/en/collections/meydan-collection/5) from the Meydan collection offered by Ramasat comes in a vivid dark bottle with the cap being the head of the horse giving it a sign of nobility and power along with a black chain dangling from the cap. For the charismatic knight who wants to conquer the day and also wants to leave a **scent trail**.

 Gold we want to wear it, smell it and also have it in our possession with the Gold line collection offered by Ramasat all of that comes to fruition. With tiny pieces of gold in every bottle you are spraying on gold with every spray, tiny fragments of gold are going to be on your skin throughout the day. Jawareh a Dubai perfume from the gold line collection with notes like saffron and vanilla will truly leave you amazed by its complement factor.

The most **beautiful scents** work together seamlessly which hence gives us wonderful Luxury perfumes, put too many incompatible scents together and our sense of smell will be overburdened, and won‚Äôt find the beauty hidden behind a Dubai scent. With the mohra collection offered by Ramasat, you are getting three different products that smell the same but work best only together. Lotion to moisturize your skin after a deep cleansing shower, along with that comes a 50 ml perfume bottle that smells exactly like your lotion so your clothing can smell like you as well and finally musk oil to apply directly to your pulse points to smell and project your Luxury scent all day long.

We often overlook how important our sense of smell is, without it we would be living in a grey world. Smelling strange smells makes us curious and that can lead to something wonderful. A lot can be said just by the way you smell so strive to smell great everywhere you go, Ramasat perfumes will carry you like the horse that never stops running till it attains greatness.

The Replica formula is too strong on the musk for me personally, it‚Äôs all I can smell. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad, but it‚Äôs just not what I‚Äôm looking for. 

Does anyone have ideas?"

Sorry, okay. In all seriousness, I'm trying to get my wife a bottle of her favourite perfume that's now discontinued and I've looked high and low and even though ebay, amazon, and a couple of other internet sellers ***seem*** to have it I partially don't trust it's real because discontinued.

Does anyone have any of the below to help my on my quest?

\- An unopened bottle you're willing to sell? (a long shot but worth a go)

2003,Perfumes,Best long-lasting perfume for men,"We all want our perfumes to last all day, to last for hours, and to stay on our skin all night. Some perfumes are light and only last 2-3 hours, others last so long that they become part of your clothes. Perfumes with a higher concentration usually last longer due to the fragrance oil inside the bottle. However, this does not always appear to be the case. The perfumes mentioned here are the longest-lasting regardless of their concentration to add to it, and they are also some of the [best Luxury perfumes](http://www.taifalemarat.com/en) for men.

**#1 Dior Sauvage** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Dior Sauvage ](https://preview.redd.it/ly26qv8qvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63eaca177e21d300f4561d653a03d8ea67ed7296)

A fragrance already loved by many, which is also very popular. It earned a spot on this list for dropping it, and while it's just an Eau de Toilette, the fragrance is a beast. It has loud, vibrant bergamot at the top and a very citrusy scent. This perfume is made for all occasions and is known to please the crowd, however, this perfume is overused, so if you are trying to find a unique fragrance away from Dior Sauvage.

**#2 The King T-10** 

&amp;#x200B;

[The King T-10 ](https://preview.redd.it/rc6l31orvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d951752f914034bb0f84f3a1e0d0c1a398c75f01)

With top notes of cardamom and pink pepper, you have a scent that leaves a trail every time you walk into a room, from Taif Al Emarat, The [best UAE perfume](https://taifalemarat.com/en/collections/taif-collection/2) that is so popular in the Middle East and for the right reasons. Middle Easterners like their fragrances to be very strong in general, so this one had to make this list due to its longevity and exposure throughout the day, and fortunately, this one isn't popular either. Luxurious Arabic perfume.

**#3 Acqua di Gio Profumo** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Acqua di Gio Profumo ](https://preview.redd.it/embu5gksvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d3fb4685fe7cdee98f6f5f5f91549d9a7b8dd7)

A stronger version of Acqua Di Gio, the best-selling men's fragrance, the DNA of this fragrance was much loved but unfortunately, it didn't last long enough. Therefore, perfumer Alberto Morillas decided to make a stronger version but this time he added incense as well, giving it a wonderful fragrance that is more deep and long, this fragrance is also all year round and also for all occasions. Definitely classic.

**#4 Dashing T-04** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Dashing T-04 ](https://preview.redd.it/hty5fmauvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e97ccb9b74f3e5284d7dd729a12ba01a43e6c0f)

Here we have another perfume from Taif Al Emarat because the brand is very popular in the Middle East, and most of its perfumes are very strong and clear. The scent of the perfume contains honey and also a very prominent oud which brings the fragrance more and more complete. Sweet and tempting scent.

\#5 Versace Dylan blue 

&amp;#x200B;

[Versace Dylan blue ](https://preview.redd.it/0u74mhbvvi381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72124f88f6cb57f503da043d7be5c23aac6c272c)

&amp;#x200B;

A true Versace masterpiece, it mostly contains fresh notes that are perfect for keeping you smelling fresh all day long. The complimenting factor of this perfume is great too, you can wear this perfume almost everywhere but it is also very popular so if you want something that is not normally found in every man's perfume collection, you may want to look elsewhere.

Get the most from your fragrances just like you would from your favorite shirt or shoes."

**What makes a perfume romantic?**

What makes a scent romantic? Flowers are usually associated with love and romance, so many popular perfumes combine scents of rose, jasmine, lavender, or other freshly cut flowers. Oriental or amber fragrances also commonly appear in romantic fragrances such as woody notes, musk, or vanilla.

**How do you know that the smell is strong?**

Usually, the intensity of the smell is less than the name of the fragrance on the bottle. The concentration of the scent indicates the strength that the fragrance possesses. Perfumes with a higher aroma concentration contain more perfume oils and less alcohol.

**How do I find my signature scent?**

Giving yourself a chance to truly appreciate if you are going to enjoy a fragrance is a key to getting your signature fragrance. ""Allow yourself time to truly experience the entire fragrance, from the top notes you smell immediately, to the deeper, long-lasting base notes.

**Does wearing perfume make you more attractive?**

Perfume can make you more beautiful: Scientists find that beautiful scents make women's faces more attractive. Researchers have noticed that a woman's appearance becomes more attractive when she smells good. They say smells can change the way we perceive attraction and perceive each other.

**Should you be sporting multiple fragrances?**

If you combine different tones of different perfumes, it can lead to a headache. Hence, apply two or more favorite perfumes to form an identity. You can get creative while mixing your fragrances, but the best way is to stay in the same family as woods, florals, fresh, and citrus because they can bond strongly with each other.

**Are men's and women's perfumes the same?**

In short, there is a level of fragrances for women and men only. However, perfumes do not have a specific gender, because there are women's perfumes that appeal to men and vice versa; There are also various fragrances that allow you to refine both sexes.

**Are perfumes unisex?**

Technically, all scents are recognizable as unisex,‚Äù says Maria Norrislamova, CEO and co-founder of Scent bird. However, brands typically market heavy fruit or floral fragrances as feminine, while stronger scents such as woody Leather and spices are considered masculine."

2034,Perfumes,Looking for alternatives to Eau de Narcisse Bleu / Vettiveru,"Hi everyone, 

Does anyone has suggestions on both of this perfumes?

I'm fascinated by Hermes' Eau de Narcisse Bleu because it reminds me this peculiar childhood smell of not a freshly watered garden, but of  water sprinkled flowers. I would buy it again but for the price, I'm looking for something that lasts longer than this cologne series, which imo is appalling.

With Comme des Garcons Vettiveru I have the same issue, I know it's a cologne and I love it,  but it just disappears after 15-20 minutes. I have a few other vetivers in my wardrobe (Guerlain, Lalique, Hermes) but they do not have this fresh, ''forest soil after autum's rain'' note that Vettiveru has.

2041,Perfumes,Recommendations for the best rose scented perfumes please?,"Hi guys!! 
Getting my mom a perfume for Christmas but have been searching for a good one for a while. She has always used the body shop British Rose which was a simple rose scent but the formula was changed so she‚Äôs no longer a fan. I want to give her something that smells like actual roses, not too sweet, not too old-lady (LOL she hates vintage sweet candy scents) and just kinda fresh? 

Thank you so much in advance!!! And happy holidays!"

Could anyone give me advice on how I might find these?"

There‚Äôs 3 others in this ‚Äúset‚Äù of fragrances. They can stack on top of each other and supposedly mingle well together. I bought 3 of them and the 1 is going back. My only other real complaint about this (these) perfumes is the lid goes on really awkwardly and you end up spraying inside the cap every single time. So that‚Äôs a waste of juice in an already tiny bottle.


Anyone else try these yet? I know they are very new. Not even on Fragrantica yet. Lol"

2067,Perfumes,Malaysian made perfume- Untold STORY,
2068,Perfumes,"Zoologist ""Moth"" review","Moth is a powdery resin fragrance with a twist. Soft but complex. First spray is a very powdery amber/resin, reminiscent of your grandma's perfumes from the 80's/90's. Give it a minute and the myriad of other notes come waltzing in, one by one. Honey, nutmeg, saffron and soft iris are noticeable in the beginning. This fragrance feels soft but chaotic, there is so much going on your nose goes into overdrive trying to settle on any dominant notes. I suppose it's reminiscent of a soft moth haphazardly fluttering towards a light source, so Zoologist have done a great job capturing the essence of a moth in that regard.

Half an hour in, it's a lightly sweetened version of the opening. Soft powdery resin with some deep spices. A light musky rose and a powdery yellow mimosa floral note can be noticed. There is a shadow of honey that comes and goes. At the six hour mark, it's a light powder which reminds me of a dusty old closet. Moth balls come to mind here.

It actually feels pretty spot on in terms of it being a scent example of a moth, with the dustiness, the old fashioned amber and the spices. It ventures a bit too far into art fragrance territory for me to want to wear it outside the house, but it is an amazing art fragrance at that. It would suit those who prefer powdery or moody fragrances."

2095,Perfumes,4 okay perfumes or 1 designer perfume?,"Help, I was planning to buy some fragrances next week. But here‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôve been thinking if I should buy like 3-4 Zara perfumes I‚Äôd like the most OR if I should buy 1 designer perfume (particularly Dior Hypnotic Poison). I know Zara perfumes don‚Äôt last very long but they‚Äôre very afforadable. Some people say they last like a good 2-4 hours ish on them. BUT the problem is if I only buy Hypnotic Poison, though it smells amazing and has insane longevity and projection, I can‚Äôt use it for every season and occassion. However, If I buy 3-4 Zara perfumes, I‚Äôll have one for every season or for a certain mood and occassion (but doesnt last that long.) Soooo, what do you think? What would you do if it were you? 

P.S. If you‚Äôve ever tried Zara perfumes, let me know your favorites and your opinions on them and their descriptions! I love a good explanation."

[Wasim Badami by Hemani](https://wbhemani.com/fragrance) is a great brand that offers more than just perfume. Interestingly, the perfume and body lotions are very hot and strong and ensure quality. Personally, I have used the scent of this brand, and I like them.

Light mist with persistent odor and aroma on the body; you will find it all under one roof. Dynasty is also my favorite, and it is priced at (PKR 2350). The amazing thing is that there are explosive floral mixed with the smell of caramel and are very sparkling.

[Saeed Ghani](https://saeedghani.pk/collections/fragrances) has been specialising in perfumes and skincare products since 1888. Additionally, what interests me the most is how they create cute, pocket-sized attar from renowned global perfumes! For example, you can get a special scent by mixing your favourite notes or fragrances.

You can get 212 Sexy and Chanel no.5 in the form of attar. They are oil-based, not alcohol. Want to know the price? Only 500 PKR! It‚Äôs really low.

In addition, they have their own perfume packaging, and you can pay extra to have the perfume in the perfume bottle.

2150,Perfumes,Perfume to use after the pool swimming (for the men),"Hi,

Recently, I started swimming in the public swimming pool. After the morning swimming session in the pool, I usually go to work, where I work in fintech.

&amp;#x200B;

The water in the pool (and the one in the showers) is heavily chlorinated. I smell chlorine after every shower. I tried various perfumes, but I was not satisfied with the results. Recently I sprayed Tokyo by Kenzo and I have to admit that it turned out to be quite an interesting fragrance marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: what men's perfume do you use after the pool to turn the smell of chlorinated water into an asset?"

I was wondering what you guys know about the age of a perfume and its performance.

I can't remember any text on the bottle but I'm sure there was, maybe in black? 
My mom seems to remember the name of the perfume being ""Tommy Boy"" could it have been an old bottle of Tommy Hilfiger Tommy Boy? I don't know because anytime I look up 'Tommy Boy' I get new pictures of the fragrance. The shape of the bottle was oval-ish. 

The scent was floral and zesty and sporty. Idk if it was a limited edition? I believe it may have been unisex.

I ordered my first KKW perfume online and after a week of waiting it just came in the mail today and the box the perfume comes in (not the shipping box, it came in a padded mailer) is totally destroyed. It annoyed me immediately and ruined my excitement of getting the perfume. The perfume bottle is okay aside from having a scratch on it, but I kinda of want to complain or ask for a refund because I don‚Äôt understand why they would ship a $40 perfume in a padded mailer.. am I being petty or is this logical?"

2303,Perfumes,Chanel No.19 Poudre vs. Prada Infusion D'Iris,Hello everyone! I tested and fell in love with Chanel No.19 Poudre and want to get a FB. But I also came across posts where people say Prada Infusion D'Iris smells identical and better and has better staying power. I am the biggest fan of Chanel and No.19 Poudre is not very long lasting but it still doesn't perform worse than Omnia Crystalline for example. I love the iris and green notes it smells like real florist shop and has feminine touch to it with that powderiness. Is Prada really better? If it has unisex feel I would stay away from it. I can't even see it at the local perfumery to test. I have been looking foe green perfume for years... So Prada is the only one I haven't tested yet and the Chanel one is a big love.

I've been searching for a nice, autumn-y perfume in ages, but so far, I couldn't find anything that didn't smell like either my grandma's super heavy patchouli perfume or an overly sweetend vanilla milkshake. 

I prefer light (but preferably long lasting) smells, which has been a pain dealing with this season, because every store I went to only showed be super heavy fragrances when I told them I was looking for a seasonal perfume. 

I would very much love a warm, but uplifting and fresh smell, like orange peels, cinnamon or cherry.

2397,Perfumes,D.S. &amp; Durga I Don't Know What,
2398,Perfumes,Need help deciding on a perfume!,"26F in the Midwest. I'm pretty new to the world of perfumes. I'm looking for a good year round, everyday perfume, or a good spring/ summer one and fall/winter one, and one for my wedding next summer. For years the only fragrances I've bought have come from Bath &amp; Bodyworks or Victoria's Secret, and I'm looking for something a little more mature. My favorites have been B&amp;BW Forever Red (love the warmth but sometimes gives me a headache), B&amp;BW Golden Pineapple Luau for summer, VS Pure Seduction (my fiance loves this one but sometimes it comes off too sharp to me?) and VS Eau So Sexy (I love the apple and cream scents in this! Might be too sweet after a while though?). I liked VS Bombshell too but it's my sister's signature scent. I've looked through ScentBird and my first delivery was Juicy Couture Viva la Juicy Noir which I really enjoy, but it's not strong enough and barely lasts an hour on me. 

I've been thinking I want something fruity and fresh but with warm undertones. I also like the idea of clean, fresh scents, like what I'm hearing D&amp;G Light Blue must be. I don't like powdery scents or patchouli, and not sure but don't think I like musk either. My favorite scents I know for sure are: apple, caramel, vanilla, honeysuckle, peach, pineapple. Not sure what flower scents I like but do know I'm not a fan of strong rose scent in perfumes. I don't want something too overwhelming but that lasts for a while and is able to smelled when I walk past someone. 

I got a couple samples of some Imaginary Author's scents and so far really like Whiff of Waffle Cone as it smells like a good burnt caramel to me, but too warm for warm weather. I've been wearing Yesterday Haze for a couple hours now and am really liking it as well, but it might have to grow on me a bit still.  I have Sundrunk and Cape Heartache I still need to try, but from the bottle, Cape Heartache is like fake Christmas tree and strawberry to me, so I'm a little nervous for that one. 

ScentBird recommendations that I'm maybe interested in: D&amp;G Light Blue (from what I read you really can't go wrong with this?), Michel Germain Sexual Noir, DKNY Be Delicious, Vince Camuto Illuminare Intensa, Clinique Happy, Confessions of a Rebel Get a Room, Burberry Brit, Burberry Brit Sheer, D&amp;G Pour Femme, Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau So Fresh, Kenzie So Pretty, D&amp;G L'Imperatrice 3, and J'ador Dior.  Someone suggested La Vie Est Belle and I got a tiny sample of it --haven't worn it yet but a sniff from the bottle smells too mature/powdery for me.  

I hope some of this helps and isn't too much! I'd love to find my signature fragrance. Thanks for any suggestions or opinions!"
2399,Perfumes,What's a good honeysuckle perfume that actually smells strongly of honeysuckle?,Wild honeysuckle is one of my favorite scents as it used to grow all over the place where I grew up.

I imagined that after having so much of the same perfume, I could dump the little bottles into an empty large perfume bottle and essentially have a full size for so much cheaper. This is more of a hobby thing btw i‚Äôve definitely purchased full sized perfumes before. But has anyone done this before?"

""It opens with unusual fruit notes of kumquat and star apple as well as lemon. The heart is a floral mix of rose, orange blossom, and stephanotis. Finally, the base mixes ambrette with musk and patchouli""

 ""Its initial intensive and energetic chord of citruses merges with an apple freshly plucked from the tree and precious kumquat. The dazzling beauty of its floral feminine heart is complemented by the bloom of orange trees and crystalline jasmine together with a beautiful rose. Its base reveals the mysterious and attractive base of the fragrance. Provocative patchouli dressed in musk combines with intoxicating amber.

the start was really masculine and woody, but only woody. i believe it was sandalwood and maybe rose(?). then you would smell a little musk then the flowery notes would come to your nose. the perfume was nearly unisex and not because of our body chemistry.

2458,Perfumes,How to Wear Perfume and Make it Last Longer,"Applying perfume in the right way will help you make your presentation more effective. Wearing a good fragrance is a great confidence booster. If you are looking to buy good scents, choosing original perfume online in the UAE is the best choice.

There are many different ways to apply perfumes, you can quickly master the art of using perfumes when knowing the right ways of it. To buy your favorite scents, you can choose Samawa and remain fragrant throughout the day.

**Here are some tips which can help**

1. The perfect time to apply your perfume is after a shower. After taking a bath, you need to gently towel your skin and spray the scent to your pulse points. In this way, the pores will soak up the smell and leave your skin smelling nice all day long.

2. You need to moisturize your skin so that it can absorb the scent. Moisturizing your body will also protect your skin from the irritation caused by the alcohol present in your perfume.

3. There are certain areas in your body where the veins are very close to the skin. Your body generates the most heat at your pulse points, and it can help intensify your fragrance and help amplify your scent.

4. Many people have the habit of instantly rubbing their wrists together after being sprayed on. Thus, you need to stop this habit as it breaks down the fragrance.

5. One can extend the lifespan of their fragrance by mixing it with unscented body lotion. You need to add a few sprays to the cream in your hand and then apply it to your body."

I always try my best to get my hands on perfumes that others aren't using. My birthday is coming up and i wanted to change my perfume. My boyfriend said he'll gift me the perfume as he's currently working somewhere they sell perfumes at discounted prices. We recently went out together with a friend and that's when he gave me the perfume. I really loved the perfume. After searching for so long i was so happy that i finally got one that i loved, that suited me and that didn't gave me a headache (I'm quite sensitive to scents). My friend who came with us smelled the perfume, she said she'll buy  a perfume as well since they're at discounted prices. We went to mado and she sniffed some perfumes and finally got one that she liked. She asked my boyfriend to get that one for her. Today i found out from my boyfriend that he got her the SAME perfume he got for me and guess what? I'm SO annoyed. At no point did she ask me if it was okay for her to get the same one as me and neither did my boyfriend gave me a heads up that the friend asked him to get the same one. I'm so annoyed at both of them (the friend does not know yet, only my boyfriend knows). Is my frustration justified? I get it that she probably didn't know that i wouldn't have liked it and my boyfriend says he didn't know that i like to keep my scent unique (i highly doubt that, we've been together for almost 4 years).

I do not have any body odor to begin with and initially thought it was my personal perception of not being able to smell the perfume after spraying it on but that has been confirmed by my bf as well.

In november of 2016 I smelt a perfume, I am still looking for. The acquaintance who wore the perfume said it was Roses de Chloe. I now wear that scent a lot since I like it very much. I suppose I like rose scented perfumes in general.

I can imagine that the perfume I smelt in 2016 was rose scented. However it did have a very distinct note that I can't recognize in Roses de Chloe. I regularly notice it in perfumes when passing by people on the street - equally often men and women, so I think it's a ""unisex"" scent that is used frequently. I would describe it as deep, down-to-earth, even magical because the smell of it makes me so happy instantly although I don't have any memories of it that I know about. Maybe it's wood?

I smelt quite a few perfume testers but I never recognized the smell or rather that one note (maybe it's not just a note, but a combination that smells so distinct to me, but I don't think so). I did definitely smell it yesterday in Dior's Sauvage. I recognized the smell on the items around the perfume (I think a little bit got onto the surrounding make up brushes) and after I sprayed it on my wrist, I wouldn't have been able to identify it from just smelling the perfume bottle and having too much of it in my nose.

If you have any idea what I could be talking about, I'd be very happy to hear your suggestions :)"

2568,Perfumes,Anyone know anything about a new Zara Jo Malone collection?,"I'm confused. I went into the Zara on Kensington High Street earlier today to see if they had a particular perfume in stock because I wanted to test it out. They didn't have it but that's not why I'm posting this. I'm posting because while I was in the perfume section, I saw what looked like a new Jo Malone collection. I think there were five of them. They had the same bottle design as the rest of the Jo Malone ones except this time the caps were metallic gold and had a vertical corrugated effect. I assumed they were new because I'd never seen them before. I tested two of them. One that had ""Oud"" in the name. *Something* oud‚Ä¶ Everyday Oud? I can't quite remember.  The other one had a citrusy smell. Again, I don't remember the name, Only that the name included a note that appealed to me. If I had to guess, I'd probably say mandarin? The only name I do remember is of one of the ones I didn't test which I'm fairly certain was called ""Leather Jardin"".

I'm confused because out of curiosity about this new collection, I googled it but I couldn't find anything about it whatsoever. Not even any talk of any upcoming Zara Jo Malone fragrances. I also searched through Zara's existing fragrances on Fragrantica and couldn't find anything relevant. I'm not sure if they're piloting a new collection in certain stores before fully releasing it or what.

Has anyone else heard or seen anything about these ellusive perfumes?"

It was given to me by a friend a few weeks ago and I felt really bad after I dropped it and glass and perfume went everywhere. When you spray it on it smells very similar to men‚Äôs cologne but when it‚Äôs on the skin or close for a while it dries and smells sort of fruity and like berries.

The bottle was in the shape of a woman. It was just a tour so obviously. It wasn‚Äôt very detailed though, it was just there to imitate a woman in mirror curves alone. The Was purple and triangular.

I hate buying expensing perfume and having it not last long :/ after a few hours of wearing the Born in Roma one, I barely even smell it and always have to re-apply (I keep a sample in my purse!)
  

Does anyone have any recommendations for perfumes that you have worn that tend to last long?

I like scents that are more warm &amp; spicy, floral, I especially like ones with jasmine or orange notes!

Valentino - born in Roma

What is similar? Doesn't have to be identical, just the same sort of 'theme' of scent - not too sweet, musky, citrus, unusual, almost spicy in some way - simply delicious as far as I'm concerned haha.

2600,Perfumes,"Where are these unknown, expensive perfumes coming from?","Silly question but I don't know how to word it. For my birthday, my boyfriend went to a perfume store. He got gizella by gabriella antosh, and Etoile by Claude marsal.

I have always loved an expensive perfume. It was suggested as a nice birthday gift. I have only shopped at department store with common name brands.

He came home with these and they smell awesome! He told me one was retailed 175. I scoffed bc even chanel is not not that expensive.

I Googled them bc I was convinced the man was not telling the truth, and the first one retails at 175. The second one retails at 250.

I Googled these perfumes to see what people said about them, and there are no reviews on any of them. There are no results about these. Odd little Facebook page here with like 175 likes and an Instagram page.

So who are these companies in general? Why do they charge so much? Why are there no reviews out there?

2605,Perfumes,My skin vastly changes every perfume I try,"I've tried dozens of perfumes, and I use Fragrantica and other websites to get an idea of a scent profile before I purchase samples or bottles.

But there's a problem. My skin (and hair), for some reason, change every single perfume. It knocks out top notes completely and goes straight for a linear base note scent. Usually it's the exact opposite of what I'm looking for, which is frustrating.

I've tried moisturizing beforehand to see if hydration is an issue. No difference.

A few examples: 

* Yawahawda J-Scent attracted my attention for it's top fruit notes, its lactonic and green sweetness, etc. On me, it's straight baby powder and amber, nothing else.
* A snagged a sample of Princess by Kilian, excited for a sweet fruit scent. Instead it's heavy lemon benzoin, nothing else.
* Anything with citrus or florals ends up smelling like bathroom cleaner or a stinky bouquet, respectively. Always headache-inducing.

I just want to know more or less what to expect when I test a new perfume - not for every test bottle to be a shot in the dark. Does anyone else have this problem? Any advice or insight? It it possible that my skin just sucks for perfume? Thanks in advance."

I‚Äôve been searching for about a year and when I smell a certain perfume it smells amazing but never just right when I wear it. I just assumed that it was mixing with my natural chemistry and continued the search. Well I tried Libre by Dua Lipa fell in love with the scent and took home a sample. The first day wearing the spray I loved how it smelled on me and I was finally through with the search. The second day I sprayed this scent on me it immediately smelt different. I decided it was due to the packaging and maybe it didn‚Äôt keep well in the sample container. Well then recently I ordered a sample of vanilla vibes which is not the type of scent I usually go for. And the moment I sprayed this on me i fell absolutely in love. The smell lingered perfectly the whole day and I was so satisfied. The next day when I spray the same amount on the same spot, I could only smell that same type of scent that came from wearing Libre. To me it‚Äôs like a burnt smell. Very hard to ignore. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just the way it mixes with my natural faramones but I‚Äôve tried spraying on my clothes rather than skin but the same results. Are they any recommendations for something that will mix with my natural scent or a way to keep perfumes from mixing with my scent?

I have an issue and I would love to hear from you if you are having the same issue.

I bought ""Flora Gorgeous Gardenia"" perfume from a Gucci boutique last week (new bottle not the old one). A week before my purchase I tried the tester in the store and it lasted for a long time. However, since my purchase I used the perfume for four times and it doesn't even last for a minute. I tried spraying it normally to my neck   then I tried a different approach by spraying on my wrists, behind ears and even to my hair according to tips I got from other people. It didn't last.

I thought it might be something related to my skin but I heard some other buyers having the same issue. I contacted the store about the situation but they couldn't give me a definite answer about is there anything I can do about the situation ( like return it, exchange it ). They will give me a call about it but before that I wanted to ask you all whether you had a situation like this and what is the procedure/ process of Gucci in these kind of situation?

Also, if I hear a negative response do you have any tips on how can I make the perfume last? I feel like I am spraying for nothing!

Thank you so much!"

I am a trained chemist with a master's degree in organic chemistry and have been making perfumes for myself and my friends for a few years. I started doing this because I have allergies to most commercial perfumes. My perfumes use essential oils with low  Ogren Plant Allergy Scale scores, ( see Orgren's book on Amazon) unless otherwise noted.  So ask me questions and check out my fledgling startup. We will add more products through the fall. Thanks!"

The fresh aroma of sea waves crashing on the coast, the woody fragrance of the dense forests and a hint of fruitiness with the scent of apples. This exquisite fragrance, the Hugo Boss Green is made for those men who live life by their own terms and are untamed.

Bob Aliano created this cologne with an eclectic combination of fragrances of Green Apple, Carnation and Cedar. This daily use fragrance contains top notes of Mint, Basil and Apple, which then leads to a floral fresh heart note of Carnation and Sage. It finishes off with a lingering masculine scent of patchouli, fir and cedar.

This post is strictly my opinion and I have paid for all these fragrances out of my own pocket. I only order the sprays, unless I‚Äôve stated otherwise, as I find them to be the easiest to use and they perform more like the original than the oils. When I first get an order in I leave the fragrances in the fridge for two to three weeks to macerate before I review them or wear them properly. 

These reviews take a lot of time and effort to write up, if you would like to order from PP I would appreciate it if you signed up with my link below. You get **10% off** and I get a little kickback also:

**Card Red Surplus 1850 - MFK, Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait de Parfum**


In my last order I got the non-extrait version of BR540 (Card Red) and really liked it. I read that this was a l more popular version and a bit deeper and denser than the normal Card Red. 

The opening is minty cotton candy as the original and the non extrait however I get a bitter smell coming through also, I‚Äôm guessing this to be the bitter almond but I‚Äôm not too sure since I haven‚Äôt smelled the original. 
In the dry down I find this to have more musk and overall this has more animalic profile compared to the normal Card Red. 

The performance and projection are excellent, projecting well for over two hours and lasting on my skin for 6-7 hours in total. To be honest I think I prefer the normal Card Red rather than this but still it‚Äôs a nice fragrance. 


**Overall: 7/10**




**Avalanche Rouge 0746 - Aventus &amp; Baccarat Rouge 540 fusion**


A fusion of Creed Aventus and BR540, wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect since this is the first fusion I bought from PP but I wasn‚Äôt surprised that I really liked this fragrance. I‚Äôm a fan of PP‚Äôs interpretation of Aventus and BR540 separately so of course I really enjoyed this fusion. 

The opening is more BR540 than Aventus, it has that minty cotton candy opening but after a few minutes you start getting the fruity pineapple and bergamot notes of Aventus coming through. The dry down is more Aventus rather than BR540 but you still get a hint of that burnt latex throughout mixed with very slight woody and smoky notes in the later stages. 

Projection is good but not great at around 1 feet and I was expecting beast performance but it‚Äôs okay at around 5 hours. 

Overall a good scent, it is exactly what you‚Äôd expect if you‚Äôve smelled both frags. 


**Overall: 7.2/10**




**Avalanche Fruity 0022 - Creed Aventus**

As the name suggests this opens with very fruity notes of black currant, bergamot and pineapple. The opening isn‚Äôt as bright or photo realistic as the OG nor is it as woody or refined as Avalanche Woody (another, more expensive, PP Aventus clone). The dry down remains fruity and bright throughout with very little woody or smoky. Overall the fragrance doesn‚Äôt develop much but has that Aventus DNA throughout. 

Projection is good at around 1.5 feet for the first hour then dies down shortly after. Performance otherwise is good, this lasts around 6 hours on my skin. This is a good scent however there are better Aventus clones available, namely CDNIM or even Avalanche Woody. 


**Overall: 6.8/10**




**Mirror 0647 - Amouage Reflection Man**


A floral but clean and soapy opening, this reminds me of Prada L‚ÄôHomme but with a more Middle Eastern twist. The fragrance opens with rosemary and pink pepper notes in the beginning giving a flowery sweet smell that still remains masculine. In the dry down you still get the floral sweet smell but the orris root and neroli add a clean and powdery element. In the much later stages the fragrance stays the same but you get more sandalwood but it still keeps that floral powdery smell throughout. Overall a very easy to wear clean and safe fragrance. 

Projection is good at 2 feet and performance was above average lasting all day on my skin, starting to die down by the 8 hour mark. 


**Overall: 7.6/10**




**Intensely Scented 1919 - Maison Francis Kurkdijan, Amyris Homme**


The opening reminds me of TF Neroli Portofino but less citrusy overall. The opening is very bright with fresh mandarin and rosemary. It has a clean and realistic smelling mandarin and instantly has beastly projection on my skin. You can continue to smell the mandarin in the dry down also. The dry down remains fresh and bright but you get some iris and a slight hint of coconut however I don‚Äôt smell any chocolate or coffee. In the later stages I get some hints of tonka and very faint depth with oud but mainly tonka. Overall this is a nice fresh but uninspired fragrance with not much depth. I think this would be hard to dislike and a very safe everyday scent. 

The projection is great at a good 1.5 feet for about an hour and I could smell this on my self throughout the day. The performance is also good at 5-6 hours. 
This is definitely going in my next PP haul!


**Overall: 8/10**




**Prominent 1799 - Tiziana Terenzi, Orion**


Straight away I can tell this is an Aventus inspired fragrance, this opens with a strong note of pineapple, bergamot and fresh fruity notes. I get a lot of woody notes come through after 10-15 minutes and this is what I imagine the ‚Äúoriginal smoky woody‚Äù batch of Aventus to smell like. The dry down is more similar to Montblanc Explorer with strong notes of bergamot and slight notes of incense too. 

I don‚Äôt have the original Orion to compare this to but from what I‚Äôve read the original is very similar to Aventus, as is this PP clone. 

The projection is good at around 2 feet for around 2 hours and performance is 6 hours before I couldn‚Äôt smell it anymore. 

Overall this is a nice fragrance; another Aventus inspired fragrance but this PP perfume smells high quality and has good performance overall. My only complaint would be that this perfume applies quite oily, I know a lot of PP sprays are oily however this is the only one I used which I could actually see 


**Overall: 7.3/10**




**Saintly S 1804- By Kilian, Angel‚Äôs Share**


The opening reminds me of Dior F√®ve D√©licieuse, I don‚Äôt get much alcoholic/cognac but a lot of tonka bean and some oak. I start smelling the dry down quite quickly too around 15 minutes in and it‚Äôs very strong praline and vanilla with a hint of sandalwood. This is a very gourmand, designer smelling fragrance and reminds me a lot of F√®ve D√©licieuse throughout. 

Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt smelled the original so can‚Äôt comment on how close it is but the projection is decent at around 1-2 feet but performance could be improved, I could smell it on my skin faintly after 5 hours. 

Overall a nice unisex designer smelling fragrance but nothing to write home about. 


**Overall: 7.2/10** 




**Glazy Flower 1805 - By Kilian, Roses on Ice**


I received a free sample of this in my last PP order and fell in love with it so I had to purchase a 30ml bottle to give it a proper wearing and of course this smells the same as the sample I received in the my last order. 

This has one of the nicest openings I‚Äôve smelled, it‚Äôs a very balanced and fresh opening with a cocktail of cucumber, lime and juniper berries. The juniper berries remind me a lot of YSL Y EDP, which is my favourite fragrance and give the fragrance a very mass-appealing blue smell.

The dry down keeps the fresh aquatic smell but adds some rose and sandalwood. The rose is very faint and I get slight whiffs of it as well as faint smells of gin. Unlike other rose scents this isn‚Äôt heavy or leathery and sweet but fresh, clean and this smells very designer. This is a unisex fragrance and I think it‚Äôll be greatly suited for a very hot summer day.

This is quite a generic scent and has an oceanic and aquatic smell to it - similar to Acqua Di Gio. I find it really pleasant however I understand this is quite different to what By Killian normally do. 

The performance is good but not great. The projection is good for the hour but this quickly fades after. This still leaves a great scent trail for about 4 hours and I can still smell it faintly on myself around the 6 hour mark. 


**Overall: 8.5/10**

I can't smell ""natural"" scents like flowers, fruits, trees, etc., but I can smell some chemically produced smells. Sometimes I can only smell very strong scents faintly (e.g., acetone has almost no smell for me).

Point is, I can sometimes smell perfume because it's chemical and not natural. Even if I can't smell it, psychologically, I like to wear it (not sure why).

There's no point in me going to a perfume store, because my nose would just get overwhelmed and I wouldn't be able to smell anything, but what kinds of scents would you recommend? I don't know if it matters, but I tend to dress quite feminine and I like pastel colors. Fruits are nice, too, and sweet things. (This is the only way for me to describe smells, lol!)"

And that‚Äôs not sweet or gourmand by any standard. 
I didn‚Äôt try every fragrance suggested last time. But I would very much like to find one that is represented in reviews as Very powerful and long lasting
Ideally, I would love to find a vanilla powerhouse to use with layered florals or even a deeper fragrance like armani‚Äôs Si with a much sweeter vanilla or gourmand base. 
As of now, I may have to layer a deeper musky floral with a standard vanilla body spray. 
I also love coconut and chocolate, caramel, toffee, etc. My ideal fragrance has cassis, caramel, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, and jasmine. Maybe ginger
I‚Äôve tried princess by killian and that is the dragon I‚Äôve been chasing for months. It lasts 5 minutes on me. Yet; it was a great deal more pricey than buying a ginger body spray and a vanilla body spray and using them at the same time

2855,Perfumes,Xarmony: Ienari (Unisex) Japanese cologne intended to make you smell like a samurai. Contains hinoki cypress and Japanese orchids.,"**r/xarmony Ienari: The orchid samurai shogun of Japan. He filled the palace with orchid blooms. It opens with undertones of cherry blossoms and purple orchid gardens. It also gives off a regal masculine scent but can be feminine. Closing with notes of Japanese Hinoki Cypress.**

Samurai would wear incense in their helmets for battle, To ward off spirits, or distract the enemy. The power of smell is something never to be underestimated. How would you swing your sword at something that relaxes you? Would it slightly alter your senses ü§î? Can this increase my chances of victory? Life is a battle. Will this help me win?

I came up with the concept during Covid19. I had only purchased one game in 2019. It was called Sekiro. The game featured a lone samurai fighting to save a child lord. It also had lots of flower petals, smoke, incense, powders, and wines. Running through temples etc. It gave an aesthetic to life around the samurai as opposed to only on the battlefield. 

I also kept remembering the ""samurai that smelled of sunflowers."" (Recurring theme in Samurai Champloo.) 

I decided that orchids held a deep mysterious presence. One that gave off the aura you would expect of a samurai. It has a certain air to it that says death might be on the horizon. Yet you are at peace with this. Or it is moreso that you know the death is your enemy and not your own.

After researching, I found Ienari. I found that Japan, to this day, has giant orchid gardens: mainly the preserved  gardens left by Ienari. The exact flower is called Neofinetia falcata. It was so beloved by him that feudal lords would attempt to impress him by delivering their own personal blooms of the powerful plant. He would sometimes give them their own estate... I assume he would expect them to cultivate on said estate.

Only samurai were permitted to grow the flower leading to the name ""samurai orchid."" It became a symbol of nobility. Wealth. A mark of fine art and class. Luxurious.

Exactly what I want in a bottle. Or what I want to give others in a bottle. A small vivid piece of high society set in matching time and tone for men and women alike.

Fun fact: In 2005 a rare variety of Neofinetia falcata,aka samurai orchid, sold for $70,000. They serve as living paintings. In some cases, more valuable and treasured than original ink manuscripts from the Edo period!"

So do you have any suggestions on sites or (if they even exist) places to get any kind of samples online? 

I've looked at sites that give you a quiz to find your ""next favourite perfume"" but I'm clueless as to what a fresh, sensual or woody scent even means. So they aren't particularly helpful to me. 

All I ask is something that's going to last more than five minutes and smells nice :( I'm sick of cheap body sprays

2900,Perfumes,Goth Perfumes,"Hello,

I am currently looking for some new perfumes with gothic/vampire vibes. 

I have always liked woody smells, the smells of churches and pine, incense. Something that would be similar to a religious mass. I am also not against a perfume with a sweeter scent like notes of amber, opoponax, ""warmer"" smells.

Just to give you an idea, here is a list of perfume I have already in my collection that could match what I want :

\- *John Galliano EDP* \- **John Galliano**

\- *Crystal Noir* \- **Versace**

\- *Eau d'Iparie* \- **L'Occitane**

\- *Poison* \- **Dior**

\- *Reve d'Ossian* \- **Oriza Legrand** 

\- *Cardinal* \- **Heeley** (not the pepper note)

\- *L'heure Bleue* \- **Guerlain**

I wanted to add *Vitriol d'Oeillet* \- **Serge Lutens** and *Habit Rouge* \- **Guerlain** but quite too spicy for the smell I would like to buy. Also, one last thing, I am not trying to find something with oud or spices in it.

I know it's a long shot but does anyone have any pointers for figuring out something that smells similar? It's a common perfume I swear, as I've smelled the exact scent in other products before, but I just can't pin it. It's quite fruity but obviously describing smells is difficult so I won't go too much into detail. After a bit of digging around online it's supposedly a passion fruit, pear and freesia scent, but the pear and freesia perfume I have doesn't smell all that close to it.. Maybe the passion fruit is the missing ingredient there, but I honestly don't know!

If any of you folks have used this conditioner before and have any pointers please let me know! It seems to be a fairly common fragrance like I said, I've smelled it in other products and also I remember years and years ago my sister had a body spray that smelled exactly like it. It's got a bunch of essential oils and stuff like argan oil etc so maybe that is contributing? I've no idea lol

2935,Perfumes,WHY WEAR FRAGRANCES? WHAT MAKE THEM SO SPECIAL,
2936,Perfumes,Perfume recs for a coastal/seaside sort of scent.,"Hi! I use perfume every day, though I'm not particularly knowledgeable about it in the way a lot of people on this sub probably are so apologies if I come across as clueless! 

That aside, I've never really had a set, signature perfume. I am only in my late teens so I've just been trying new things out, receiving various scents for Xmas and such. In the past I have worn kenzo world, paco robanne pure xs for her, and im just finishing up on my bottle of modern muse (my current perfume) 

I'm going to need to purchase another once I've finished with this bottle, and although all of the scents I've previously tried are pleasant, I have a specific sort of scent that I am after and need some help finding something similar to my ideas. If anybody could help, it would be much appreciated! 

I've searched for perfumes with coastal, ocean type of tones, however most suggestions seem to fit more into the concept of a summer breeze or a tropical beach with coconut and driftwood and such. 

To sort of put an image to the scent I'm after, think more along the lines of English seaside, stormy beach, rainfall, blue, fresh and unisex (not super strict on this, I dont mind if it is more of a feminine or masculine scent, so long as I dont smell of lynx aftershave haha). I'm a massive lover of the beach and coastline, particularly in stormy and colder rather. I also love rain. So basically, I'm trying to find a perfume that merges these things together. When I say a seaside scent, I want to steer clear of summer and sun and coconuts etc! 

Would be great if the perfume isn't a super niche brand to make getting a hold of it easier. I would need UK shipping if it is only available online too, which may be relevant. 

This is probably incredibly specific so I'm not expecting a ton of answers but thought it would be worth a shot! Thank you in advance and again, sorry for how niche this is."

2966,Perfumes,Dupe for Vivieene Westwood 'boudoir' ?,"My sister received boudoir for one of her teenage birthdays some time in the early 00s and kept it in a cabinet in her room. Basically, she didn't use it and had it more so for display, and when I entered my teen years and she begun clearing out old possessions, she passed it onto me and told me I could do with it what I wanted. I used it all, despite its probable age, and was gutted to see that it has since been discontinued. I haven't used or thought about it in a few years now but something reminded me of it earlier today and now I would love to get my hands on something as similar as possible. I honestly think it is one of my favorite scents of all time and I've not smelt anything else even similar to it. 

If anybody knows of anything that smells as similar to boudoir as humanly possible, or better yet, if there is a way I can still get a hold of boudoir itself, it would be very much appreciated. There isn't any particular notes I like best from it, its just the whole thing as a combination. It is truly so divine (although probably too overpowering for some, understandably!) 

I've checked online but the sites that looked hopeful also ended up being out of stock too, so my guess is that it is just no longer being made.

However, recently I heard that storing them in the fridge is the best way to prolong the performance of a perfume. How does everyone else store their perfumes and should I start storing mine in the fridge?"

2976,Perfumes,I need some advice,"

Hi guys, I recently ordered my first quality and expensive perfume, and I would like to get started into taking care of myself more ( hitting the gym etc), and that includes perfumes. I would need some recommendations for perfumes to wear in a basic day/school day [ I am 15 years old ]. And a curiosity of mine is: Are testers worth it? I fell in love with a perfume: Dior Fahrenheit ( damn it smells good ), but at its price i can buy 2 other good quality perfumes that I like. It's not that I can't afford it, it's just that I think I could be more responsible with my money ( parents' money ), and maybe get a better deal and do something else with the money I saved. Thanks for your time &amp; attention."

2989,Perfumes,"Looking for a light, lemon-lime soda-like scent","Several years ago, when I started working full-time in an environment that never seemed to be a comfortable temperature, I picked up a habit of wearing a perfume to sort of trick myself into feeling warmer or cooler than my actual environment. I had a favorite Etsy shop that sold rollerball perfume oils, and they had a lot of scents I loved. Unfortunately, the shop has since closed, and I‚Äôm looking for a replacement for one of their scents.  

I generally lean unapologetically toward warm perfumes: sweet, spicy, woody, etc. As a result, I have plenty of options for cooler temperatures. The air conditioner is broken in my workplace at the moment, though, and it‚Äôs making me realize just how better-suited for fall and winter my collection really is. Light Blue is pretty much my only truly warm-weather perfume, and it doesn‚Äôt *quite* scratch the itch I have.  

There were a few scents from this Etsy shop that I loved in warmer weather (and I‚Äôd welcome recommendations for any similar scents). My favorite was a light perfume that was based on ginger ale, blood orange, and lemon; it was basically like smelling of lemon-lime soda, and I‚Äôd have sworn it could actually help make the hot weather bearable. Another good one was strawberry, jasmine, sandalwood, and amber, which, while sweeter than the ginger ale perfume, was also quite light. The third was frangipani, lime, pineapple, and sea salt.  

If anyone has suggestions for similar perfumes, particularly a cool, sparkling, sweet citrus-y scent like the ginger ale-inspired perfume (which was Siren Soap‚Äôs Nixxie, on the off chance someone might recognize it), I‚Äôd be very grateful!"

2991,Perfumes,Alternative/similar fragnances to Ramon Monegal's (Faisa),"Hello everyone!

I recently visited Spain and i came across Ramon Monegal's eau de parfum called Faisa. I was amazed with the smell and i instantly fell in love with it.

The fragnance itself includes Saffron, Ylang-Ylang, Lemon, Cinnamon and Anise as top notes, middle notes include Agarwood (Oud), Rose, Raspberry, Jasmine and Mimosa; and base notes include Amber, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Tonka Bean and Caramel.

I was tempted to buy it however the price put me off at that time (‚Ç¨190). Is anyone aware if there are any similar (preferably cheaper) fragnances that have similar ingredients and smell?

Thank you in advance.

P.s it might be a silly question however i am new to the whole fragnance world"

I‚Äôm actually normally more of a fresh, citrussy scent kind of girl (my all time faves include Herm√®s Un Jardin Sur Le Nil, Versace Versense). But something about this little apple blossom, vanilla, bergamot concoction spoke directly to my heart. It also seemed to work perfectly with my skin chemistry and always resulted in people complimenting how I smelled. Tried the Eau Fraiche version when that was all I could find, but the magic was sorely lacking.

So, any pointers or advice towards finding something similar will be super welcome. Don‚Äôt want anything too sweet as this fragrance did not react as sweet on me. Thanks in advance :)"
2999,Perfumes,"Looking for fragrances similar to Lush's ""Light Touch"" facial oil","I recently bought the Light Touch facial oil (not a perfume,but a moisturizer) from Lush and i'm obsesed with it's scent. The website says the fragrance of the oil is mostly geranium and lavender but on the ingredient list, a few others like Chamomile, Olibanum and Myrrh are mentioned, as well as one mysterious ""fragrance"" that leaves me wondering what goes on that makes this bar smell so pleasant.

My problem is i'm very inexperienced in the world of perfume and I can't recognize any of the fragrance notes that are in this product. I don't even know what geranium smells like, and i don't smell a lot of lavender in it. 

But i do know this solid oil smells kinda fruity and flowery, and very fresh it's almost child-like, nothing like the usual Lush spice. 

Does anyone with any knowledge or experience with this product and fragrances, recognize familiar scents or could suggest perfumes with a similar feel?
